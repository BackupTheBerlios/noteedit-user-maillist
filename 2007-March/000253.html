<PRE>Hi Karen,

I use Ubuntu and have played around with NoteEdit - have been meaning to 
get back to it.

I'm not in front of my linux box right now, but if memory serves...I 
think that there may not be a way to get the &quot;C&quot; from NoteEdit.  You 
should be prepared for a lot of little issues like this with NoteEdit 
and with any other open source notation editor.  I don't think that any 
can hold a candle to Sibelius (except that they all blow it away in price).

Here's what I would do: Enter your music as best you can.  Skip any 
problems that you get stuck on.  Then export your music to Lilypond (or 
one of the other text formats that NE supports).  Manually edit the 
Lilypond file (you'll need to learn Lilypond: 
<A HREF="http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.10/Documentation/user/lilypond/Tutorial">http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.10/Documentation/user/lilypond/Tutorial</A>) with 
a text editor (Emacs has a lilypond mode - Vi might too) and then print 
the music.  You should expect this process to be slower than writing out 
the music by hand on manuscript.  Lilypond produces really nice music 
though.

The NE team is now working on Canorus (<A HREF="http://canorus.berlios.de/">http://canorus.berlios.de/</A>) you 
should keep an eye on that. Denemo 
(<A HREF="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/denemo/">http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/denemo/</A>) is another project, but it is 
less mature than NE.  You might also take a look at Rosegarden which you 
can download with apt or synaptic if it is not already under one of your 
Gnome (or KDE?) menus.

Best of luck.  What is your instrument?  Let me know how it goes.

Below is a message that I sent to this list (no response) detailing some 
other problems that you might run into.
&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm really enjoying Noteedit.  Thanks for all of your work.  I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> running 2.8.1 on Ubuntu Dapper (using Gnome) but I have KDE libraries 
</I>&gt;<i> installed and things seem to be working pretty well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be grateful for info about any (or all) of the following problems:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Beaming:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have set my staff to 4/4. I am trying to enter a half rest, 8th rest 
</I>&gt;<i> and then 3 8th notes.  I want the 2nd two 8th notes beamed but I want 
</I>&gt;<i> the first to stand on its own. If I simply enter 3 8th notes, they all 
</I>&gt;<i> get beamed together. If I enter the first two 8th notes (upbeat of 3 
</I>&gt;<i> and downbeat of 4) and then I hit Backspace they are un-beamed, but 
</I>&gt;<i> then when I enter the 3rd 8th note they all get beamed again. I've 
</I>&gt;<i> tried various combinations of using Backspace and clicking the Beam 
</I>&gt;<i> button on the tool bar but so far have not been able to achieve what I 
</I>&gt;<i> want.  I also tried marking the two 8th notes that I want to un-beam 
</I>&gt;<i> as a block and then clicking the Beam button a couple of times. 
</I>&gt;<i> Nothing seems to change.  I could probably edit the exported file, but 
</I>&gt;<i> if it's possible to do this in Noteedit, I'd love to know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the answer might be Edit &gt; AutoBeam...but I don't see a way of 
</I>&gt;<i> indicating how many notes I want automatically beamed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Custom Chords:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm creating leadsheets for use in a jazz context. I would like to 
</I>&gt;<i> enter chord changes and I would like these changes to transpose when I 
</I>&gt;<i> transpose the piece.  For this reason I don't want to enter the chords 
</I>&gt;<i> as arbitrary text.  At the top of the Insert &gt; Chord dialog there is a 
</I>&gt;<i> text box that looks like it might be a place to enter a custom chord 
</I>&gt;<i> symbol.  For example, I would like to be able to enter &quot;B-7b5&quot; or 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;F#7+9&quot;.  Is there a way to do this?
</I>&gt;<i> Editing:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I went to edit mode to change a measure in the middle of the piece.  
</I>&gt;<i> Somehow I ended up with a bar of 4.5 beats: 8th rest followed by 8 8th 
</I>&gt;<i> notes.  The only way I was able to fix this was to delete all of the 
</I>&gt;<i> bar (did Undo several times) after the offending measure, re-enter the 
</I>&gt;<i> bad measure and then reenter the rest of the piece.  Is there a better 
</I>&gt;<i> way I could have done that? Is there a way to get Noteedit to 
</I>&gt;<i> recalculate the measures and correct the bars?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you very much for your time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Brian

&gt;<i> Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> I'm Karen Rodgers, a recent user of both Ubuntu, and NoteEdit.  I'm a music 
</I>&gt;<i> major, and quite frankly, a cheapskate (else I'd be using Sibelius).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am having trouble making the program do what I want.  This is a problem, 
</I>&gt;<i> as my semester project must be done with a music editor.  I'd like to turn 
</I>&gt;<i> in some of my assignments in using it as well, so I get a feel for this 
</I>&gt;<i> thing.  So far, that has not been a rousing success.  How do I get it to 
</I>&gt;<i> use the letter &quot;C&quot; to indicate
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;common&quot; time (yes, I know it's the same as 4/4, but if &quot;C&quot; is what's 
</I>&gt;<i> written on the assignment in the book, it had better be on the homework as 
</I>&gt;<i> well.
</I>&gt;<i>
