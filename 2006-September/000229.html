<PRE>Dear list,

after I inserted a midi-statement in the lilypond-file I had created before,
I could load the resuling midi-file in noteedit, and after a few steps I had
my scores back.

After I updated to noteedit 2.8.1 and continued editing.

Now after hacking in 7 lines of 75 bars each there are two other problems:

Lilypond export does not work. Noteedit exports a version 2.0 lilypond 
file, although at start-up it had found my 2.2.6 lilypond installation.
Lilypond 2.2.6 is unable to compile the version 2.0 file. Also convert-ly
does not work in this case. 
There are also problems with pmx export.
Direct musixtex export works, but I cannot format it. Trumpet voice has one
page and one line, and I would like to print it on one page.
Also I did not find out how to print the partition in landscape format.

second problem is that midi export is done with half speed.
For notation speed 120 is correct, but for the same tempo midi speed has to
be 240.

maybe someone can give me a hint. Specially the format problem could be one
of working with musixtex, latex, kdvi...
here a friendly RTFM might be the right answer.
But the midi and lilypond problem are certainly not.

Anyway, I will get my music printed, and carneval 2007 will be the great
performance...
Thanks again to the noteedit development team for the great program!

Regards Thomas
