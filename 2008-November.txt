Dear users and developers,

It is really important to understand that I fully respect the work of the
Developer-Team and don't want to offend or insult anyone.  I believe that there
is a need of a superior and complete, free and open source notation-solution
and that's the reason why I'm posting this.

Because I believe in the greater good first and then in personal achievements
and goals right behind it ( I am a Musician after all) I think it is right to
discuss why an project exists from time to time.

This is off course provocative and I expect that there will come out an constructive
output out of such discussion. Don't mistake provocation for an insult, please.

So why does this particular notation-program exists? Because there should be
an FLOSS notation-app, capable of probably running cross-OS and with all the
abilities a composer and musician needs.

The expectation on such a program is high, as you may already know. It should
be feature-full but fast to learn and use, should produce a beautiful output
and should include some advance play-back functions, to name only a few points.

And all this by a group of spare-time devs? (no qualitative statement, just
a matter of time)

The question is why there are so many Linux/Cross-OS notation-apps available
and why is, sadly, non of these ready to be used in the hard and unfair world
of commercial concurrence.  The open apps, like this here  are usually not just
free but they also feature most of the time some innovative and fresh concepts
and features which can not be found in the commercial world. But it seems that
all the free apps lack of completeness in basic features, common notation things.
One program has no multi-measure rests, the other has no repeat-bars, another
one can't transpose. These might be details and "easy to implement once the
framework is done" but in reality these are the reasons why these programs are
not ready for the real job.

I will call this "basic-feature-completeness"  just the "Version 1.0" from now
on.

I believe every developer knows that the Version 1.0 is just a matter of time
and they are fully aware what their application can do and what is still missing.
This is exactly the reason why there is no 1.0 notation-program until now and
every approach got closed and abandoned before 1.0 and new approaches are spreading
each generation until they will probably perish, too, because they get to old
before they are fully usable and new technologies are avaible and up-to-date.

The reason behind this is of course that its not possibly to create a up-to-date
notator with few people like ins common in the open-source scene. Even if you
are highly motivated and don't have to fear about time-/moneyloss its not possible
to achieve.

If you follow this theory the question follows: why is there a need for so many
attempts to create a notation app? The goal is the same for anyone: create notation
for paper-print, computer-print and playback. Why not join forces and use all
the devs avaible to create a state-of-the-art notation program which even competes
with the commercial world.

"My way is the best and only!" you will probably say.  Maybe you will say "I
would, but I can't code C/C++ or phyton or java  or whatever the project uses
which comes nearest to my own ideas". Or maybe you did not know that there are
other projects or did not know how much are they 1.0. Or maybe you are just
out for the reputation and pride to write the super-notator alone :)
Except the last case any of these problem has a solution. Even with all the
obstacles that come with fusions like stepping away from the leadership, using
different programming-languages and so on, in end it will be faster and better
to work together.

So: Why not join forces? (You see this is a philosophical discussion because
there is no discussion about who joins who)
