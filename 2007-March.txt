Hi,

I'm Karen Rodgers, a recent user of both Ubuntu, and NoteEdit.  I'm a music 
major, and quite frankly, a cheapskate (else I'd be using Sibelius).

I am having trouble making the program do what I want.  This is a problem, 
as my semester project must be done with a music editor.  I'd like to turn 
in some of my assignments in using it as well, so I get a feel for this 
thing.  So far, that has not been a rousing success.  How do I get it to 
use the letter "C" to indicate
"common" time (yes, I know it's the same as 4/4, but if "C" is what's 
written on the assignment in the book, it had better be on the homework as 
well.

Thank you for your time,

Karen Rodgers

Hi Karen,

I use Ubuntu and have played around with NoteEdit - have been meaning to 
get back to it.

I'm not in front of my linux box right now, but if memory serves...I 
think that there may not be a way to get the "C" from NoteEdit.  You 
should be prepared for a lot of little issues like this with NoteEdit 
and with any other open source notation editor.  I don't think that any 
can hold a candle to Sibelius (except that they all blow it away in price).

Here's what I would do: Enter your music as best you can.  Skip any 
problems that you get stuck on.  Then export your music to Lilypond (or 
one of the other text formats that NE supports).  Manually edit the 
Lilypond file (you'll need to learn Lilypond: 
http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.10/Documentation/user/lilypond/Tutorial) with 
a text editor (Emacs has a lilypond mode - Vi might too) and then print 
the music.  You should expect this process to be slower than writing out 
the music by hand on manuscript.  Lilypond produces really nice music 
though.

The NE team is now working on Canorus (http://canorus.berlios.de/) you 
should keep an eye on that. Denemo 
(http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/denemo/) is another project, but it is 
less mature than NE.  You might also take a look at Rosegarden which you 
can download with apt or synaptic if it is not already under one of your 
Gnome (or KDE?) menus.

Best of luck.  What is your instrument?  Let me know how it goes.

Below is a message that I sent to this list (no response) detailing some 
other problems that you might run into.

Subject: [Noteedit-user] Canorus 0.2.5 is out
Message-ID: <45FF620C.9030604@gmail.com>

Canorus development team is happy to announce the new release of Canorus
- a free cross-platform music score editor, version 0.2.5. The release
took lots of effort from core developers, various contributors, testers
and translators. This release mostly brought huge under the hood
changes. Among others, the most notible features are the new GUI and
LilyPond support.

Finally we would like to mention a close-related project to Canorus,
Harmonia (http://harmonia.berlios.de). A project aimed at harmony
analysis which works as a Canorus plugin.

Changes summary:
- New Doxygen documentation.
- Initial work on MacOSX port.
- Improved function marking rendering
- Scripting engine now offers integration with Canorus menu, import/export
dialogs and keyboard and mouse events.
- New completely XML CanorusML format.
- LilyPond document export support.
- LilyPond voice import/export support.
- Rewritten GUI. Now supports multiple main windows. Added lots of icons.
- Translations support. Current translations: English, Slovenian.
- Majority of the code rewritten so we have a more robust foundation now for
future development.
- Lots of warnings, crashes, bugfixes and memory leaks fixed in MIDI,
GUI and
Scripting engine.
