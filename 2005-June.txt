Subject: [Noteedit-user] 2.8.0 Release Candidate 1 released
Message-ID: <42A1B990.6000100@web.de>

This is the release candidate in the release cycle of the coming 2.8.0 
release of NoteEdit.
If you still find bugs post them in the Bug tracker. or mail them to the 
developer mailing list.
Known bugs can be found in the Bug tracker as well.

Since now, we were successfully maintaining the original English, German 
(most of NE developers), Slovenian (myself) and Slovakian (Zdenko 
Podobn?) translation. However, we did not recieve any progress report or 
confirmation about the translations to other languages.
Let me remind you that the deadline to commit the translation files is 
on Sunday, 12th June 2005, 23:59 CET.
Translations not being sent until Sunday will not make it to the stable 
2.8.0 version.

Please contact us immediately if you're making or going to make the 
translation work for your language. If we won't recieve a confirmation 
within 48 hours, we will assume that this message didn't reach
you and we'll start to search for another translators.

Subject: [Noteedit-user] Up/Down Bow?
Message-ID: <200506050002.55290.johan@ekenberg.se>

I'm new to Noteedit, but so far very impressed with it. However, I need to 
make bow markings, up-bow and down-bow for violin and other bowed string 
instruments. Is it me that just can't find it, or is it missing from 
Noteedit?

Regards,
/Johan - Double Bass Player

Unfortunately, this is missing. Same with fingerings, for piano players
important. So a noteedit score will look more like unedited original work ;)

I can imagine that you could use sforzato and portato in NoteEdit and,
if you export to lilypond, translate those in the .ly file with a little
(perl-)script

while (<>) {
        s/-\^ /\\upbow /g;
        s/-- /\\downbow /g;
        print;
}

until this is implemented. Further questions are ok,
Regards,
Georg.

NoteEdit doesn't re-check, needs be started after timidty. Then you'll
see the ports .... kaconnect and other tools are also good to see what's
going on.

Message-ID: <42B5D25D.9060003@web.de>

Hi!

As you probably already noted the 2.8.0 release is still pending.
As we just got some improvements to the german translation and
I don't have the time for a release today and tomorrow I will
do it on tuesday. That leaves some time for last-minute tests
as well. I there is any reason not to release 2.8.0 please tell
it very soon because for the Linuxtag me, Georg and Matevz would
really like to have the release out.

I hope to have some time left on the Linuxtag to start the
2.9.x branch. After that everything is open again :)

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Thanks for the feedback :-)

Well I use lilypond, not abc as export. Lilypond has an option
to select one or several staffs from the score during export.
As I don't use ABC I didn't notice that the abc export doesn't
have that feature. So the only way would be deleting the staffs
manually in noteedit before exporting them to ABC.

Hallo

If I want to print with noteedit via lilypond,
do  you recommend the stable branch (2.4.6)
or the developement branch (2.5.32)?

Thank you

with many friendly Greetings

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Stable 2.4.x branch is currently known to work. We didn't do much
tests with 2.5.x, because most of distributions don't include it as a
part of the stable config yet. However, I don't think there should be
much issues with it. At least convert-ly should convert the 2.4.x
syntax to the latest version properly.

Ok, I put the online documentation online again :-).
I also put up the new homepage as all of you probably already noted :).
Also for those knowing the "new" homepage already: I added a help page.

There is still some work to do:
- Properly integrate the FAQ
- More screenshots from you.
- Make a script modyfing the generated html pages from meinproc in a
   way that it fits to the homepage design.

I leave this work as an exercise to the reader :-)

Do you have enough expertise in the internals of noteedit to add easily such
a button into the abc export interface (even not functional; from what I have
read in the other export.cpp, I think that I could make it work myself) ?
I have found the exports.ui file, but don't know how to edit it myself.

Kind regards
