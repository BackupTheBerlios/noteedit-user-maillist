Subject: [Noteedit-user] Two ultra-noob questions
Message-ID: <200708021826.35480.gcmbl@cebridge.net>

Hello, Listies!

I am embarrassed to be asking both of these question - clearly I am missing 
something obvious, but here goes:

I cannot for the life of me get NoteEdit to continue the staff of a single 
voice onto a second line on the 'page'. The only way I have found to have 
more than one line is to do Staff > New Staff, which seems to me to be 
starting a second voice, as it requires a time signature instead of just a 
clef, and starts the measure numbering over. It causes other complications as 
well. I would like it to note four measures, then drop to a new line.

Second question: In spite of my setting US Letter as the page size in the 
print config dialogs, an A4 request is always sent to the printer. I can 
print via the print preview, but this restricts my ability to set margins, 
etc. I would like to set US Letter as the default page size.

As must be clear from these questions, I am new both to music and to notation 
software. I am very happy to find NoteEdit, and as soon as I get by these 
initial bumps, am going to enjoy putting it to use in my Ultimate Quest - to 
become an Intermediate Guitarist! Someday, someday...

Thanks for your time!

NoteEdit only uses the horizontal view of the score  - that is  the
unlimited long tracks of the staffs and other lines. If you want to print
the score, the score is exported to LilyPond format and converted to PDF.
LilyPond is a typesetter tool specialized for engraving the score (see
http://www.lilypond.org).

Second question: In spite of my setting US Letter as the page size in the

You can set this in print dialog below where various options like export
drum notes, font size, page etc. settings are available.

Hello, Matev?!

Thank you for your fast and useful reply! 

I have tried the one-long-track trick, and it works just fine! Thank you for 
straightening me out on that.

I am still a bit lost in regards to the A4 bit, however. I have indeed set US 
Letter in the 'Page Geometry' box on the 'Lilypond format' tab of the print 
dialog. It still sends an A4 request to the printer. Other apps do print 
normally, BTW. 

Is there any other place I can look for a page size setting?

Thanks again for your time!

You can always export to LilyPond manually (File->Export->LilyPond) and edit
the created file with your favourite text editor and set the page size
somewhere at the beginning of the file. When done, run
$ lilypond myfile.ly
and it will produce a printable myfile.pdf for you.

Subject: [Noteedit-user] Linking two staves
Message-ID: <1187223309.30091.17.camel@karl>

Hullo there.

I feel like a fraud in this mailing list, because I know next to nothing
about music (I can whistle, though...).

I am trying to use Noteedit to transcribe a handwritten piece of music,
so that I can print it out nicely.

The handwritten piece has two staves, and the bar lines link the two
staves neatly - the bar lines run from the top line of the top staff to
the bottom line of the bottom staff so the bars "line up".

I can get two staves in Noteedit, but I cannot "tie" the staves
together. Is this possible in Noteedit, and if so how?

Regards, K.

PS: I looked at Canorus too, but it just crashed and crashed :-(

Another beginner question: How do I get more than one stave? I want a
melody to be printed as several staves, one above the other, not as one
long staff, which is all I can seem to do.

"Staff->New staff" gives me a new staff alright, but it is tied to the
staff above, not a continuation of it.

NoteEdit has unlimited lengths of the staff, so you don't need "line
breaks". When you print music or export to PDF, it's engraved automatically
by LilyPond or whichever typesetter you prefer.

Use Format -> Document Layout. Select staffs you want to link and choose
from Brace, Bracket and/or Barline.

Subject: [Noteedit-user] Anacrucis in noteedit?
Message-ID: <1187355657.6024.65.camel@karl>

Is there any way to tell noteedit that the first little bit of a score
is "short" (It think thetechnical term is "anacrucis"), so that Lilypond
doesn't complain about the first and/or last bar's timings being wrong?

I've worked around it by adding the rests to the first and last bars,
but...

And while I'm wasting your time, is there any simple way to tell
Lilypond (preferably from inside noteedit) where you want the "line
breaks"? I'd like four lines, each of two bars, but I get one line of
three and one line of five bars (with the first mysteriously indented).
I fear I may have to delve into the Lilypond notation language to fix
this...

Thanks, K.

Thank you for this and your other answer. Much appreciated.

It seems noteedit is very KDE-centric; printing turned into a nightmare.
Now I just take the Lilypond output file from noteedit and do "lilypond
filename" and lo! I get ps and pdf output with no problems at all; these
I can then print myself.

Of Canorus is noteedit without these difficulties, I can hardly wait.

For anacrusis use hidden rests (the blue cross with the red cross).

Thank you! I actually sorted it out the hard way - went into the
lilypond output and inserted "\partial XX" instructions.

I must confess that as a new user of notepad I find it has a very
counterintuitive and highly modal interface, with many unfortunate cul
de sacs. For example, if I mark a set of notes and press "beam",
noteedit will beam the notes together. But highlighting the beamed notes
and pressing "beam again" does NOT unbeam them! The only way I found to
correct such an error was to delete and reenter the notes. The
"autobeam" function seems entirely capricious - noteedit always beams
adjacent quavers together, no matter what I try to stop it doing so. It
will beams three (in a 6/8 piece) then the fourth will not be beamed -
but if I insert a fourth quaver *before* the three beamed ones, it will
be autobeamed into the group. Good if that's what you want, not so good
if that's NOT what you want. There seems to be no way to change the
length of a note - say from quaver to semi-quaver - without deleting and
reinserting the entire note.

But maybe I'm missing something.

Regards, K.

For changing the note length, go to edit mode (hit E key). This allows
you to change properties of already placed elements.

Subject: [Noteedit-user] change volume for all voices
Message-ID: <200708262227.26020.finkandreas@web.de>

hello,

i created a note sheet, with two staffs, and every staff has two voices. If I 
set a volume sign, then only the first voice is affected. How can I change 
the volume for both voices in the first staff? Or is there the possibility 
two merge the first and the second voice?

thanks for your help
Andreas

MIDI settings like volume, instrument etc. can only be changed for the
whole staff. So the only way is to move the second voice to a new staff.

But if MIDI settings are changed for the whole staff, why keeps the second 
voice its loudness, while the first voice will become louder/lower?
To change the loudness for the second voice I have to go to "Staff -> Voices" 
then click on the register staff, and change there the volume to something. 
But it is not possible to change the volume with an loudness-sign. If using a 
loudness-sign, only first voice will change its loudness... Why cannot all 
voices change its loudness (that's what I expected from a loudness sign)
