Hi Marcos,

Thanks for your detailed answer to my questions. I also forwarded
it to the NoteEdit Mailing lists in case other are interested in
the Musix distribution as well.

Concerning the patches for tse3: There are compile fixes for gcc 3.4 and 
amd64 as well as a fix for alsa1.x and sustain. Also NoteEdit 2.8.0 will 
not compile with gcc 4.0 (fixed in the SVN repository of NoteEdit).

To really find out what went wrong with tse3play configuring you would
need to either show us your config.log or check the output from
configure (i.e. what was missing when tse3 was configured).

Concerning the problem that 2.8.0 disappears: This is already fixed in 
the SVN repository in case you did not read the corresponding mail on 
the NoteEdit ML.

Just one question is left: How does Musix compare to Demudi or better
asked wherein do your goals differ from other audio distributions ?

Regards,

Reinhard
