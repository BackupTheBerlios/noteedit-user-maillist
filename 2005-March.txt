Hi,

since the actual debian-package is 2.7.1-2 I tried to compile
noteedit 2.7.4 from source and got the errors listed below.  I'm not
using kde, so maybe I just have to install some other kde-related
packages?  I called configure without any options.

Can someone help me getting noteedit compiled, please?

TIA

Hello Til,

before going too much into details: Might it be helpful first to build 
noteedit 2.7.1, that you get most of the packages needed, that apt tells 
you what you need to install? On my Suse I first installed the 
source-rpm of noteedit and did rpmbuild. The rpm-spec file triggered the 
installation of many many packages.

The file INSTALL might also be helpful. Give a note if you don't have luck.
Best Regards,
Georg Rudolph.

You need at least kdelibs4-dev, libqt3-mt-dev and libqt3-headers 
package. Note that you have to add the 
--with-qt-includes=/usr/include/qt3 parameter when running configure 
script, otherwise NoteEdit won't find the Qt library.

Subject: [Noteedit-user] export liylond 2.4 lyrics problem
Message-ID: <423111DF.9040704@schwaben.de>

Hi all,

before completing the implementation I would like to share with you a 
lilypond export format, mainly a modfied \score block, which will give 
us more features, I think. It allows us to put lyrics in print not only 
beneath the staff, but also over or in mixed fashion anywhere in the 
score. I attach an exported .ly file where you can see the basic format 
and maybe do experiments.

To have in noteedit lyrics always below the music is perfectly okay, 
because in noteedit you are an aranger. But in printout it should be 
easily possible to make everything more compact, for example, combine 
two voices and flip the lyrics as you whish. I just inted to export this 
format also as a helpful hint for the user that he might be able to 
modify the exported file and create a patch. It took me quite some time 
to extract everything out of the lilypond documention. And Matev?, this 
is the format I once mentioned.

Any thoughts about it are welcome. I hope to close bug #3403 with this 
whithin next week. I just would like to mention, that multi voice (not 
chords) usage crashed quite easily for me, so I avoid it currently.

Best Regards,
Georg

Before downloading the source of noteedit 2.7.4 I installed noteedit
2.7.1 using apt-get to get the required packages automatically.

kdelibs4-dev, libqt3-mt-dev and libqt3-headers are installed:

ii  kdelibs4-dev   3.3.2-3
ii  libqt3-mt-dev  3.3.3-8
ii  libqt3-headers 3.3.3-8

And these additional qt-packages:

ii libqt2 2.3.2-14
ii libqt3c102-mt 3.3.3-8
ii libqthreads-12 1.6.7-1
ii qt3-dev-tools 3.3.3-8

And these additional kde-packages:

ii kdelibs-bin 3.3.2-3
ii kdelibs-data 3.3.2-3
ii kdelibs4 3.3.2-3

It tells me to set --prefix=<path_to_your_kde_installation>, so...

til at debian:~ - kde-config --prefix
/usr

...I ran
./configure --prefix=/usr --with-qt-includes=/usr/include/qt3
with make giving the same result as above without --prefix.

So I do.  ;-)

qarray.h is located in libqt3-compat-headers package. Install it as well 
and it should work.

Yes, that's the structure I had in mind as well. Everything is moving
around contexts: staff context, lyrics context, chords context,
tablature context, general bas markings context, harmonic analysis
context etc. Lyrics with multiple stanzas are treated as a separate
Lyrics contexts for each stanza. That's what you actually implemented
and it's perfectly ok.

One question though: Does numbers 1. and 2. (stanza numbers) appear at
the beginning of the stanza (or after it?)? Because I think you should
write the \set stanza = "1." BEFORE the actual lyrics... but I'm not
sure:).

Woops, sorry for the last post. My brains are a bit soured already at 
this hour:). \set stanza is ok. You first set it

		\context Lyrics = cStaffAA { \set stanza = "1." }
		\context Lyrics = cStaffAB { \set stanza = "2." }
		\context Lyrics = cStaffBA { \set stanza = "1." }
		\context Lyrics = cStaffBB { \set stanza = "2." }

and then use the actual text with:

		\context Lyrics = cStaffAA \lyricsto cStaffAA \StaffATextA
		\context Lyrics = cStaffAB \lyricsto cStaffAA \StaffATextB
		\context Lyrics = cStaffBA \lyricsto cStaffBB \StaffBTextA
		\context Lyrics = cStaffBB \lyricsto cStaffBB \StaffBTextB

and so on.

Hi Matev?,

Ok, but I'm still a bit confused and doing it blindly, these contexts ... :)

Before checking in I will sort out PianoStaff- and other braces. What 
makes me still work hard without success is exporting a drum staff, drum 
notes enabled, with different kinds of drum notes in one chord (in one 
voice). Maybe someone on the list can give me a hint how lilypond want's 
to have that. I attach a small example to play with. The error message I 
get is

lexport.ly:37:41: Fehler: syntax error, unexpected MUSIC_IDENTIFIER, 
expecting DRUM_PITCH or NOTENAME_PITCH or '>':
        \bcr g'8 \btr a \bcr b g e' e d < g, \bt
                                                r e' > | \bcr g a b g e' 
e d e |   % 3 not good

Maybe we have to go a different route with \drummode instead of only 
choosing other note heads? And if we don't find a solution, hm, we 
should go the save road then ...

Best Regards,
Georg.

Hm... wierd. I forwarded the problem to the LilyPond-devel mailing list. 
They'd probably know better than me:).

About the \drummode mode, I think that NoteEdit really needs the concept 
of contexts like in LilyPond in the future. So if you'd insert a 
percussion staff, all the notes will be drum notes, if you insert an 
ordanary staff, you'd get normal notes and 5-line staff, if you insert 
tablature, you'd get 6-line staff and tablature notation etc. Until 
then, using different style of noteheads is the best possible solution IMO.

and get a different context. We can then switch noteheads, but 
octaviation gets out of sync and steming gets uncoordinated, so it would 
need more investigation. So for the moment, I tend to switch notehead 
changing inside a chord off. Maybe you could play with and maybe have an 
idea?

Thanks for sharing. The free mixing of drum notes and usual ones should 
be possible also in the future. It makes changing the drum sound very 
easy. A mapping of a clean drum stuff to a standard drum notation could 
be a solution, maybe. Probably we should have as many drum note heads 
like for example lilypond for this. I'll also think about it ...

Best Regards,
Georg

I checked the Lily mailing list later and found out the same thing you
did. The style of noteheads is hardcoded to the voice. So if you
change the style of noteheads, it changes the style of the whole voice
automatically, so there's nothing useful here, we could make. I think
the best suitable option is not to have different style of noteheads
in one voice at all. The solution would be for eg. adding additional
voice only for that part of the score (and of course aligning the
stems, so it'd look like one voice). But you should do all that
manually for now.

High Matev? and all,

noteedit can now again export lyrics with multiple verses. Check it out 
if you like, comments are welcome.

The drum notes problem is also "fixed", in that changes inside chords 
are not propagated. But instead you can use different voices, and that 
works quite well. This I only learnt now. Different voices I should use 
much more. All examples in the source tree are now rendered reasonable 
well in lilypond.The use of contexts could be extended to multiple voices.

What puzzled me: A \PianoStaff only allows positioning of lyrics below 
the pair of staff. Maybe this is also a candidate for a question on the 
lilypond list. And bracing and bracketing when some staffs are not 
selected I will work out soon (score layout). And which lilypond 
versions backwards we could not test/brake?

This mail I send again, because I didn't see come it through.
Best Regards,
Georg

Hm... why should you have lyrics in piano staff anyway? All choir and
other sung music is always inside a bracket (and not brace - brace is
stronger. It always includes single instrument - piano, organ etc.).
But I don't know if that's what Lilypond wanted to really implement in
this case. On the other hand, I don't remember an example where you
should use \pianoStaff and needed lyrics for it. \choirStaff should
support lyrics between the pair of staves instead.

About Lily versions, under Debian the problem is that Debian testing
and unstable both include 2.2.6 version of Lilypond. So we cannot make
any changes until both testing and unstable include 2.4.x in their
repository if we want to stick to and only to 2.4.x. However, we can
drop support for versions prior to 2.2.x. What about Fedora, SuSE,
Mandrake?

High Matevz,

occasionally I stumbled over a command to allow lyrcis inside 
GrandStaff. Because I like it orthogonally, I added it when needed. Yes, 
it's more when doing not so classical designs. I closed bug #3403 and 
added a few lines to our NEWS file. Two, three more bugfixes and we make 
a new release? :)

Agreed. I tested with lily 2.0.3, so 2.2 should work also like before. 
SuSE had problems with lily out of the box, 9.3 will do hopefully 
better, already with 2.4 i hope. Btw., packman supplies rpm's for SuSE, 
so new releases will spread easily.

Best Regards,
Georg.

Subject: [Noteedit-user] Howto: Create PDF / HTML Documentation
Message-ID: <424C4904.4070507@web.de>

Hi!

I just wanted to let you know how you can create a html and even
a pdf/ps documentation from the index.docbook file.

If you want to create the german version of the documentation
you need to copy the german index.docbook from the doc/de into the
doc/noteedit directory.

Now change to the doc/noteedit directory.

Call "meinproc index.docbook"
This creates several html files from the docbook file.

You can now watch the documentation with
<favourite browser> index.html

To create a PDF file you need htmldoc.

I use the user interface for creating the doc, but it can be
done via command line as well. As this is easy I leave it as
exercise to the reader ;-)

Input: Select all html files from the file requester
Sort the html files like in the table of content from the index.html file
index.html file is the title file.
Output: PDF
Page: Page Size (A4)

I encountered 5 table errors when "Generate"ing the document.
The result is a 134 (german version) long pdf file. The table
of contents is currently twice present, one of them could be
omitted.

See appendix (of the mail, not of the documentation ;-)
for the noteedit.book htmldoc file.

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann
