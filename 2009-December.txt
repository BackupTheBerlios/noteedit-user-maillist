Subject: [Noteedit-user] Guitar Score Problem (stem orientation)
Message-ID: <3ca8db5c0912181954t543684d6p52b7649100423139@mail.gmail.com>

Hi:

I am a new user. I am trying to print a guitar score but I have a problem.
When I am working on NoteEdit the stem orientation is right on screen, but
when I print the score the situation is different because almost all the
stems are backwards.

I think that I need more vertical distance between scores in order to avoid
this problem... but I don't know how to fix this setting.

My typesetting  is Lilypond.

You can find a screenshot in the attached file.

Thanks,
