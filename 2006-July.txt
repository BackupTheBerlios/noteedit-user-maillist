Subject: [Noteedit-user] New here ... Help (F1) in NoteEdit not found
Message-ID: <20060701125310.225260@gmx.net>

Hello,
I'm new here in the list, and I'm a newbe on LINUX - 1 year experience on Redhat9 and SuSE 9.2. 
My system now is SuSE 10.1 on a AMD Sempron3000+ - machine. 
Installed libtse3 is ver.0.3.1

I'm a programmer of a brilliant Multimedia-Midi-sequencer for the Commodore AMIGA computers and it's clones(AROS,MorphOS and OS4). Also I tried a port to JAVA (much incomplete yet). I'm a studied church musician.

Today I could compile and install NoteEdit complete ... but with some problems I had to solve:

1. the "config" couldn't recognize the libtse3, which is placed in /user/lib. Also not with the option --with-libtse3-libs=/opt/lib.

2. the tse3-includes where not available on the SuSE 10.1 Install-DVD, so I installed them by hand to /opt/kde3/include/tse3 from the archive from the tse-site.

3. To ensure configure doesn't break I added these two lines after line 31612
lib_libtse3=/usr/lib
inc_libtse3=/opt/kde3/include/tse3

4. I deinstalled the version 2.8.1, which came with SuSE 10.1, because in this compilation the keyboard doesn't work.

5. 'make' and 'make install' worked with some warnings (mostly the well know cast-warnings), but without to break.

6. Configured new the KDE-menu-entry for NoteEdit (example: the icons were in another dir in SuSE 10.1 from the previous installation).

Now all works OK (as far as I could see ... up to now), but when I press F1, the Help doesn't start. From the central SuSE-Help I can call the Help for NoteEdit.
Is it possible to solve this ?

At last: NoteEdit is a very impressive good Notation Editor. Sure, at the beginning (like in each program) the most time is needed to read the very good made manual.

If someone have had worked with programs like Finale or Sibelius before, some new things must be learned. But don't complain about missing features ... read the manual complete. Anything is not so comfortable, like in Finale or Sibelius, but NoteEdit is Freeware, and the commercials, like Finale or Sibelius are very expensive, and the result (on the printed sheets) is not so much better.

I congratulate the developers for this real good program, and I can guess how much efforts are neccessary, to make such a good program. Keep on your good work.

Kindly
Alfred

Hi,

I'm using noteedit for many years now and mostly, I insert notes by typing 
letters (I'm not using a midi keyboard).

1.) I can make dottes quarter notes with pressing eg "4 . c <ENTER>". But 
often there is a pattern like "4.c <ENTER> 5d <ENTER>", that is, after a 
dotted note there is a half length note following.
Can we make noteedit to have a key for "enter dotted note and next note is 
just half length" ? Capella does this with the "," key.
For my above pattern, you would have to type "4,c<ENTER>d<ENTER>"

2.) Can we have keys for changing the actual note to "legato", 
"staccato","accent",... ?

Uli

Message-ID: <44CAA480.7040302@yahoo.com.br>

Hi.

I am wondering about if there is a way to use newer versions of NoteEdit 
with kdebase-3.3.2. I have NoteEdit 2.7.4 (on Debian), and I cannot get 
a newer version without update *a lot* of packages along. Since I use a 
dial-up connection, I can only upgrade the distro very rarely.

The same problem I find with GTK programs, and that is an additional 
reason I prefer programs which do not require QT or GTK or any GUI at all.

To make the things worse, it seems that there is no way even to compile 
new versions of NoteEdit from the sources to get compability with 3.3.2.

Is there some way to face this problem? Perhaps statically linked 
binaries? Any suggestion?

Cheers,
Hudson

NoteEdit needs KDE>3.0, so if it doesn't work with 3.3.2, it's the
Debian's maintainter decision.

Could you be more precise? I'm using Debian myself and I can get the
latest SVN version of NoteEdit compiled fine. You need to download the
qt3 development packages and TSE3 sequencer and then type:
$ make -f Makefile.cvs
$ ./configure
$ make

I think statically linked libraries aren't the answer because NE depends
heavily on the underlaying KDE system. I don't know how the different
version of KDEs would work together.

With the libraries for KDE 3.3.2, I can use NoteEdit-2.7.4-1. The new 
version in Debian testing is 2.8.0, but it requires updating the KDE 
libraries, remove a lot of packages, and many other changes (almost an 
entire distro upgrade).

I tried with the RPM package for 2.8.0 (converted with alien) from:
http://abcplus.sourceforge.net/#noteedit
with no success.

I have read somewhere that I would need to compile the entire KDE (!!!) 
to do that. But I think I am confusing Debian package dependencies with 
other issues. I could not install qt3 because the numberous dependencies 
too.

I am using Debian-3.1, release 0  +  Demudi-0.19 with some updates.

That seems bad. Sometimes I think that environments with integrated 
software, like KDE or GNOME, are just a bad idea. Hopefuly in some time 
point in the future a solution for better compatibility may arise so 
that one can run programs alone without need installing an entire 
desktop only because them...

Is there any NoteEdit-2.8.* binary package for Debian-3.0 anywhere?

Hudson

You can always unpack the .deb package manually ($ ar x
noteedit-2.8.0.deb), change the dependencies manually in the
control.tar.gz and repack it and install the package.

No, NoteEdit isn't part of the KDE, it's only "integrated" meaning that
is uses some of its libraries, so the icons, font style, sound engine
ARTS in the past, were taken from the current KDE environment. You don't
need to recompile to whole KDE to compile NoteEdit.

Not that I know of currently, sorry. You should try the testing/unstable
package and change the dependencies manually as I said before. It should
work :).

Hi Matevz & Co.,

I'll try to translate the feedback of a german user of NoteEdit

Dear Mr Katzmann,

Since some yeare I use NoteEdit to create MusiXTeX Code in easy manner.
NoteEdit was always a great help to accomplish it especially easen the
input .

I'd like to make some remarks to the program especially as you have
called upon it.

The user interface is notedly good. The input is in my opinion much
easier as with many commercial programs on Windows (like Finale or
Capella). Unfortunately
the display on the screen is complex (crowded). I don't expect WISYWIG
but still
the screen display could be a little bit more polished.

What I really find annoying is the input of slurs (ties?). On a
polyphonic movement 
only one slur can be set. Also the arrangement of the slurs above or
below the
staff does not work correctly. Here the program is in the need for an
important improvement.

At the moment I can't switch off the fermatas at the beta 2.8.1 version.
If I activate
the fermata function every following note has an fermata sign on it.

The generated TeX-Code does not always correspond the music typographic
rules.
On eigth notes f.e. larger distances are created especially in
conjunction with Text
than it is typically  seen in the music typography.

Also I wouldn't disagree to enhance NoteEdit to a extensive tool
handling the export and import of all the freely available music
notation languages (ABC, MusixTeX, Lilypond, MusicXML etc.) to allow a 
versatile  exchange especially in the face of
the commercial programs.

I was very happy to hear that a development team was founded to continue the
development of NoteEdit. Despite all the critics I'm very thankful for
all the
work already achieved and looking forward to the coming versions.

With best regards yours Martin Trautner

Message-ID: <200607281710.54186.m.trautner@gmx.de>

Lieber Herr Katzmann,

seit einigen Jahren benutze ich Noteedit, um auf einfache Weise MusixTeX-Code 
zu erzeugen. Noteedit hat sich dabei immer als gro?e Hilfe erwiesen, die die 
Eingabe sehr erleichtert hat.

Gerne w?rde ich einige Anmerkungen zum Programm machen, zumal Sie auf der 
Homepage von Noteedit dazu aufgerufen haben.

Die Bedienoberfl?che ist ausgesprochen gut. Die Noteneingabe ist meines 
Erachtens wesentlicher leichter als bei vielen kommerziellen Programmen unter 
Windows (zum Beispiele Finale oder Capella). Leider ist die Darstellung auf 
dem Bildschirm un?bersichtlich. Ich erwarte kein WYSIWG, aber etwas 
aufger?umter k?nnte die Bildschirmdarstellung schon sein.

Was ich als besonders l?stig empfinde, ist die Eingabe von Bindeb?gen. Bei 
einem mehrstimmigen Satz l?sst sich nur ein Bindebogen eingeben. Auch die 
Anordnung des Bindebogens ober- und unterhalb der Notenzeilen funktioniert 
nicht richtig. Hier liegt entschieden Verbesserungsbedarf vor. 

Im Moment lassen sich bei der Beta-Version 2.8.1die Fermaten nicht abstellen. 
Aktiviere ich f?r eine Note die Fermaten-Funktion, wird jede weitere Noten 
ebenfalls mit einer Fermate bei der Eingabe versehen. 

Der erzeugte TeX-Code entspricht nicht immer den musiktypographischen Regeln. 
Bei Achtelnoten werden beispielsweise besonders in Verbindung mit Text gr??ere 
Abst?nde erzeugt als in der Musiktypographie ?blich.

Ich f?nde es im ?brigen nicht schlecht, Noteedit zu einem umfassenden Werkzeug 
auszubauen, das sowohl den Export als auch den Import aller g?ngigen freien 
Musiknotationssprachen (ABC, MusixTeX, Lilypond, MusicXML usw.) beherrscht, 
um einen vielseitigen Austausch auch in Hinblick auf kommerzielle Programme 
zu erm?glichen.

Ich habe mich sehr gefreut, dass sich ein Entwickler-Team nach dem Ausscheiden 
von J?rg Anders gefunden hat, um die Arbeit an Noteedit fortzuf?hren. Ich bin 
bei aller Kritik dankbar f?r die geleistete Arbeit und freue mich auf 
kommende Versionen.

Mit besten Gr??en, Ihr Martin Trautner
