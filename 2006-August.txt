Hi, I'm a new Linux user, and I'm just wondering if anyone has a good
example of a noteedit file showing some of its abilities, so I can get
an idea how it looks.
Thanks!

Best is to look at NoteEdit's screenshots:

Thanks.
Some of the things I'm looking for are to be able to make noteheads
invisible, to make entire notes invisible, with ties to show a note
being held across where the note isn't there, clefs on different lines
than their usual positions, and with 8va or 8vb above and below them,
different sizes of notes on one part, stuff that isn't standard.  I'd
like to be able to position anything manually when necessary.  I also
need to write banjo tablature, and to write with no key signature (not
just in C major, I need transposing instruments displayed without key
signatures as well).  Harmonics for violins...  And arbitrarily odd
time signatures...
I guess I'm wondering how customizable things are, or if Western
notation rules are pretty much enforced.

I hope I don't sound like a punk demanding things of free developers-
I don't mean to do that, it's just that I'm trying to make the switch
to Linux, and if I can't find a way to do those things I'll have to
keep booting Windows in order to use Finale, for the time being.  I
don't think Lilypond is going to do it, I have to be able to move
stuff with the mouse.

I've uploaded a 2.8.1 archive but can't test if it compiles, as my KDE
is broken.
(Would need to upgrade > 400 MB so this will wait until I have my Mandriva
2007 Beta or better RC version).

You can get it here:
http://prdownload.berlios.de/noteedit/noteedit-2.8.1.tar.gz
If somethings fails try make -f Makefile.cvs first. If that is the case
someone
needs to upload the modified archive again.

I recommand to use KDE 3.4 as minimal version though any KDE3 version
should work (but probably requires the above reconfiguration of the
automake stuff).

Best,

Reinhard

Hi Chuck.

NoteEdit is more like composing tool. For printing, it exports the score
to LilyPond and Lily's job is then to fit the score nicely to the paper
(it produces PDF to print).

I advise you to first create the base score in NoteEdit (easier score
creation for the new user in comparison to Lily from scratch IMO) and
then export it to LilyPond and add any more exotic stuff which NoteEdit
doesn't support manually.


Regards.

Hi Peter.

Did you remove your official (distribution) NoteEdit version and run
make install under root after compiling the new version of NoteEdit?

Remove the old version was successful. The problem is, Suse Linux 9.2 does'nt find the path, where Noteedit is installed. And therefore Noteedit does'nt find the Printpreview (or need I therefore a special program?) and the helpfile and so on. Maybe I have to set the path (but how to do)?

Yes, you need a special program to use the print preview. We recommend
using LilyPond. This is also the default preview program NoteEdit calls.

I am using Note Edit on Suse 10.1, KDE 3.5.1a, AMD 64 system. A number
of Note Edit's edit functions which worked on Suse 10.0 now do not work.
Trouble with bar insertion (can only be done by copying a bar from
another location), delete (can only be done by ctl plus mouse click),
editing dotted notes, birds eye holds, and a few others I don't remember
is not possible. Am considering re-compiling with a fix found under
"delete" in bug reports, but would appreciate any additional
information.   --ED--

Hallo Matev,

 The problem was, I had not installed GV 
for print preview, so it was my own fault.

 Thanks for help and for the great program.

Hi,

Try to remove any old NoteEdit versions before installing
the new one. NoteEdit requires and installs a library and
not only an executable.

Best,

Reinhard

Hi,

I seem to remember that SuSE has kde installed at a special
place. Did you set the KDEDIR variable to that place? it might
be the case that NoteEdit installs it's files at a place where
KDE cannot find them (like the help file).

You can also manually set the paths with the configure
script but that's a lot of more work.

Best,

Reinhard

Hi,

Which version of NoteEdit do you use? For KDE >= 3.5.x
version 2.8.1 is required. I still have to wait to update
my system to 3.5.x (but I use Mandriva and not SuSE
and I don't have a 64bit system to test it).

Best,

Reinhard

Hi Peter,

You can use any other program for print preview which
supports display of pdf files (even better display of
postscript and pdf files) like kpdf or kghostview. Just
change the print preview settings.

Best,

Reinhard

Subject: [Noteedit-user] [ANN] NoteEdit 2.8.1 released
Message-ID: <44DE03ED.50206@web.de>

Hi,

The NoteEdit team is happy to announce the long awaited new release
of the score editor NoteEdit.

You can directly fetch the sources from here:
http://download.berlios.de/noteedit/noteedit-2.8.1.tar.gz

Please note:
This is the last major release on NoteEdit. Since some month the core team
concentrates it's development on the NoteEdit successor called Canorus.
More information can be found here:
http://canorus.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Main_Page

The new version 2.8.1 contains the following major changes since the
last release:

- New direct printing and print preview support using different backends:
  - Implemented custom print dialog.
  - New settings in Configure dialog for printing.
  - Custom preview application (eg. kpdf, gpdf, xpdf, gv).
  - Custom typesetting application (LilyPond, ABC, PMX/MusiXTeX).
- Enhanced UI:
  - mouse wheel behaviour improvements (zoom in/out, quick scroll, vertical
  scroll),
  - added keyboard shortcuts (select n-th voice directly, start/stop
playback,
  insert special barline, goto measure),
  - few dialog improvements (insert clef or barline, page layout),
  - new dialog: Insert special barline.
  - remember the last position of action (useful when deleting the whole
block
  of the score),
  - rewritten scroll behaviour (especially when the selected element is
  out-of-scope),
  - red border when Edit mode is active.
  - added vertical line which connects all staves
- MusicXML improvements:
  - import arbitrary text.
  - export arbitrary text.
  - export all strings in UTF-8 encoding.
- LilyPond export filter improvements:
  - arranger is now exported.
  - document page size is exported.
  - rit./accel. signs are printed in italic.
  - export all strings in UTF-8 encoding, if Lily >2.6 is found.
  - official Lilypond font sizes are now supported
- gcc4 complete compiler support. Many warning fixes and internal cleanups.
- Many documentation additions and fixes.
- New translations and translation updates

More details (including bug fixes and detailed changes) can be found
in the NEWS file and the ChangeLog file of the archive.

The reasons for stopping major development on NoteEdit were discussed
on the NoteEdit development mailing list some time ago. You can read
the thread here:

Thanks. This is what I had suspected, but I had not yet seen any info to
that effect in my searches. (Suse 10.1 shipped with Noteedit 2.8.0?)
Will try newer version as soon as I get Createrepo installed. Have been
too busy editing music to attend to details like that.
Thanks again. --ED--

Hi,

I just recently updated the download page. It still pointed to the
meanwhile removed beta version.

There are some music-specific distributions like Agnula Demudi
(Debian/Ubuntu-based), Studio 64 (for 64bit machines) and a
software archive called CCRMA for music apps build for RedHat
Fedora (maybe even a complete CCRMA based distribution exists).
For SuSE you should take a look at jacklab. Also multimedia distributions
exists like dynebolic (Agnula actually aims to be a multimedia distribution
as well).

Best,

Reinhard

For NoteEdit traditionally packman did the job. Check this too.

Hallo ED,

I had a lot of trouble with Suse 10.1 too. (In former times I used Noteedit 
under Suse 9 and everything worked fine.)

To solve my problem I uninstalled Noteedit 2.80 and took the Noteedit 2.81 
tar.gz and compiled it by myself at /usr/local/src . I had to add some libs 
that ./configure asked for (libtse3 was not so easy to be found, so I took 
all tse3-stuff from the Suse-DVD that was offered). Starting the programm is 
not so comfortible as before (prompt in spite of menue) but everything works 
well. 

Best regards

Hans-Peter

Thanks, I  have downloaded the source files and am planning to do just
that. But I made the mistake of using the update icon from the panel
menu, and now my YaST2 does not install or uninstall anything. I don't
know if I will be able to fix this without re-installing the system, so
have been putting off the work of hand installing NoteEdit 2.8.1 until I
find out.  Meanwhile, I am downloading a copy of Debian to compare to
SuSE, planning to run it from another HD. Thanks to Reinhard for info
leading to this decision.

The Suse's are served now with even the newest noteedit by packman,
google for packman, suse, and you'll find  the rpm for NoteEdit.

Message-ID: <200608172214.09152.dr.burmester-beer@t-online.de>

Hallo list, 

while probing noteedit 2.8.1 I could not switch off the articulation signs 
like staccato, tenuto, sforzando and so on. It is no problem to change among 
these signs, but there seems to be no way back to plain notes. The same 
happens with piano-glyphs and drum-notes. This mistake causes no problem for 
me because I do some post-processing with abcm2ps in every case to polish up 
the score and fill in microtonals sometimes. But I thought it should be 
mentioned.

Best regards
Hans-Peter

I noticed many of these same problems with NoteEdit 2.8.0 under the
system which requires 2.81 (KDE 3.5 and later, I was told.)  I  found I
could delete the note and then replace sometimes to turn off these
signs, or if that didn't work save the work piece and restart NoteEdit. 
The most stubborn instances of this problem happened when using edit
mode to add the feature, so I work around it by deleteing the note and

That NoteEdit ``feature'' to hard-attach decorations to notes is more 
like a bug. One cannot have both staccato and accent in a same note?

Fortunately, that limitation is not planned for Canorus, as I could read 
on the projetc page.

Hi Hudson,

many thanks for your microtonal, cluster and space-notation stuff. Especially 
the microtonals are very important for a proper notation of multiphonics on 
woodwinds. 

The completion of hard-attach decorations and articulation signs is easy to be 
done in abc.

But the insertion of microtonals in Canorus would be very helpful for a 
correct playback of ones composition. No more laborious tests with 
Zynaddsubfx. 

Best regards

Hans-Peter

Microtonals could be easily played-back using the Tune MIDI property. It
has +/- 64 steps of the whole tone. This way you could get the proximity
of... 1/64 of the whole tone. Sounds like a nice feature for Canorus :)

Any microtonal composer will tell you that 1/64 of tone is simply too rough.

You might use 14 bit pitchwell messages (bytes order are reversed), 
giving a resolution of 1/8192 of tone. That is the resolution 
implemented in abc2midi (http://ifdo.pugmarks.com/~seymour/runabc/top.html).

An important issue is that such messages apply to all notes in a same 
channel. As result, chords cannot have mixes of different microtonal 
accidentals (currently in abc2midi, any microtonal accidentals in a 
chord are ignored).

> Sounds like a nice feature for Canorus :)

Indeed.

Cheers,
Hudson

I guess you are refering to my ABC stuff: abcm2ps extensions (.fmt 
files) and the microabc program?

http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/abc-pt-2006-04-24.zip
http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/?M=D
http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/microabc.html

I have made also a quarter-tone fingerings chart for recorder and a 
equal-temperaments explorer for Csound:
http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/misc/

Still about microtones, one can now use tclabc/tkabc 
(http://moinejf.free.fr) as graphical interface for quartertone music. 
This is my .tkabcrc file implementing several keystrokes:
http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/_tkabcrc.txt

I called them ``hard-attached'' decorations because one cannot 
edit/add/change the accents/articulations independantly of their carrier 
notes in NoteEdit.

> But the insertion of microtonals in Canorus would be very helpful for a 
> correct playback of ones composition. No more laborious tests with

Have not still you tried microabc? You can generate microtonal MIDI 
files with abc2midi, from a ABC file with aliases for the microtonal 
pitches.

Latest version of the program:
http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/microabc-2006-07-29.zip

Margo Schulter has used microabc to typeset her music using the Sagittal 
(http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf) microtonal 
notation system:
http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/microabc_neomedieval.zip

I can't convert MusixTex-Files (my favourite format) 
with noteedit. 
When I used Noteedit 2.8.0 an did convert them on the
terminal it was not a problem.
Maybe I need a newer version of Musixtex (my version: T.99-830 (Suse 9.2))?
On this case: it is difficult/dangerous to install a newer one? And where can I get the sources?
This is the error I get:

Exporting with /usr/bin/musixtex note_19e8Ve.tex This is TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2C 7.4.5)
Finished export.

Hi Peter,

have a look at

If you need help subscribe to the mailing-list.

I found musixtex too difficult to handle and therefore switched to abcm2ps.
Take a look at 
http://abcplus.sourceforge.net/

I am fairly new to some of this software. What advantages do Musitex or

Hi ED,

Musixtex and Lilypond belong to the Latex-family in the largest sense. If you 
want to edit the source-code of your composition (insert decoration or 
advises for playing that noteedit does not offer) it is not so easy if you 
are not a "texpert".
 Abcm2ps is simple ASCII and generates a postscript-file scorename.ps with the 
single command: abcm2ps -c -O= scorename.abc . The syntax of abc-files look 
not so cryptic for musicians and is comparatively easy to handle.

Best regards
Hans-Peter

Nearly correct, Lilypond though is no longer dependent on (La)TeX
within it's current releases. Lilypond does not require TeX knowledge
though to use it and it (like Musixtex) includes quite some examples.
I prefer it mainly because I like the better output of it and has a much
simpler syntax compared to Musixtex. There exists frontends for Musixtex
(like PMX) offering a simpler syntax. Musixtex exists longer than Lilypond
but AFAIK there is not much development going on compared to Lilypond.

A short comparison of abc to the above two languages can be found on the
abcplus homepage (abcplus.sf.net). One thing is probably not mentioned:
Lilypond can be expanded with scripts.

Canorus will also support abcplus at one day. Lilypond will surely be the
first exporter we will implement (except someone having developed a abcplus
parser can easily adapt it to Canorus).

Best,

Thanks Hans-Peter,
     I am beginning to understand Lilypond to some extent, and it seems
to have the same qualities you describe for abc.  Does abc do anything
that Lilypond won't?

Thanks Reinhard,
    This pretty well answers my question, and confirms what I had read
on the subject before deciding to study Lilypond first.

Hi ED,

if you need a pretty looking output of late-romantic scores you should prefer 
Lilypond. If you need outstanding contemporary stuff you should try abcm2ps 
with the addons of Hudson Lacerda (visite his site).

I have to confess that I don't know Lilypond so well that I cannot say what 
solutions it offers for modern notation-problems.

Best regards
Hans-Peter

Hi Phil,

I'm sorry but neither me nor Georg can help you with your problem
as we are using other Linux distributions (Mandriva and SuSE).
I crossposted my answer to the NE User Mailing List.
If you follow the installation requirement NE should compile.
Currently my system is so broken KDE-wise that I even
can't compile NoteEdit myself.

Best,

Reinhard

Note to Phil;
    I can sympathize with you on the installation problem. I just came
thru about 2 weeks of the same kind of trouble with SuSE 10.1.  Can't
help with Ubuntu, but if you were refering to the Debian package, there
is an earlier version of Note  Edit  that comes with their CD set. I
used that version with Suse 10.0 and believe it might do until you solve
your Ubuntu problems.   --ED--

To Phil:
you can try to make this in Ubuntu:
apt-get source noteedit
cd noteedit-2.8.0

in mainframewidget.ccp you must change line:
keys_ = new KAccel(this);
to
keys_ = new KAccel((QWidget*)this->parent();

then
fakeroot dpkg-buildpackage
cd...
su -c dpkg -i noteedit*.deb

In my situation (Ubuntu 6.06) it works good.
The update manager even says you may change your version for update:not
do it! Then when the new 2.8.1 will in the ubuntu repositories, we will
look at.

Emilio

Finally got my OS straightened out enough to install NoteEdit 2.8.1. 
More of the edit functions work now, but I am still seeing some sort of
disagreement between NoteEdit and KDE. Using the scroll bars in NoteEdit
often causes the headers to disappear  and creates randomly placed lines
through  my  desk top background and icons.  KDE team says this is not a
bug in KDE.  Has anyone else experienced this sort of behavior?  Have a
few screen shots, but don't know if I should send them to this list.

Do I have to do something special to delete notes and rests using the
backspace or delete keys?  At the moment neither is deleting
anything...
I'm also not sure how to delete a beam that I entered, or delete a slur.

Thanks!

Try pressing "Ctrl" key while clicking on what you want to delete.  This
worked for me when I was using noteedit 2.8.0 on SuSE 10.1. Since I
upgraded to 2.8.1 the delete key works for most things. There seems to
be a disagreement between some versions of noteedit and KDE. You have to
be using the proper versions of both to get the best results.

Sorry I didn't finish my earlier reply, Chuckk;  my keyboard batteries
went out suddenly. Any way, try using Ctrl while mouse clicking the
element you want to delete.  For beams, go to edit mode, highlight the
first notein the beam series, and turn off the beam button on the tool
bar.  To delete slurs, if edit mode does not work, delete the first note
of the slur, then replace it.
