Subject: [Noteedit-user] Compile error

Hi all,

I tried to compile noteedit 2.8.1 beta on a Suse 10 system. 
Unfortunately "make" stops with the following output:

Any help is quite appreciated.

Hi Claudius,

This problem was fixed some weeks ago, so if you want
to try it out immediately fetch the current version from SVN
which also fixed a path problem with print preview.

The final release should appear really soon now, just
how soon is another question :-)

Search the archives for nscaleedit.h, there the cause & fix is
explained for the problem.

Best,

Reinhard

Hi Reinhard,

thank you very much for your quick answer. I was trying the latest 
SVN-Beta und was happy  to see it compile properly. The program 
itself is getting better and better :)

Best,
Claudius

Hi,

Finally the release candidate one week later than planned due to the
german documentation updated has been released by me. As usual
report any problems with the release candidate to this list. The only
planned changes are updates to the translations as there were quite
some user interface updates during the beta period.
Have fun with the RC!

Hi,

I 'm new here. I use noteedit 2.8.0, debian testing, sony vaio notebook, 
gnome 2.14 desktop.

The keyboard insertion mode doesn`t work for me. I can't neither change 
the note lenght with the keybord, nor the insertion point. Nothing 
happens, when I press the "A" button.

Any idea here?

Hi,

I've just tested with NoteEdit 2.8.1 Release candidate:
- Activate keyboard insertion mode
- Add clef, key signature and time signature
- optionally switch on automatic beam/bar insertion (configuration)
- Select mouse position with cursors

-> A red note appears for me.

Hi,

with noteedit 2.8.0 on openSuse I see the same here. With a newer
version, let's say the release candidate 2.8.1, changing the note length
with the keyboard is working. Inserting the note itself with the
(computer) keyboard is not so helpful, I guess. I'm doing that with
mouse or midi keyboard.

Hopefully you can get hold of the new version and use it instead?!

Regards,
Georg

Hi,

a small addition: With the release candidate the insertion of a note
works per keyboard only when the red keyboard icon is activated and you
press shift. With shift+A I get an note A. In the shortcut definition
dialog it's defined like this.

Georg

I had the same problem. If you can't use a new version, you may do this:

apt-get source noteedit

in mainframewidget.ccp you may change the follow line
keys_ = new Kaccel(this);
to
keys_ = new Kaccel((QWidget*)this->parent();
then
cd noteedit-2.8.0
fakeroot dpkg-buildpackage
cd..
su -c dpkg -i noteedit*.deb

I have received these instructions and now (in Ubuntu 6.06) noteedit
works well.

Emilio

Does this work with CapsLock active instead of using Shift?

I like the keyboard input in the form a|b|c|d|e|f|g for pitches, it 
allows fast insertion of notes. I think also that all features should be 
available without need of using the mouse or complex keystrokes for 
basic operations.

I have yet another question:

Is there already a fix for the impossibility to insert two or more 
articulation marks like staccato, tenuto and accents? Those 
insert-note-with-articulation buttons were a really bad idea.

Hudson

Subject: [Noteedit-user] multiple voices and keys
Message-ID: <1149002080.9426.6.camel@localhost.localdomain>

hello,

I'm using noteedit 2.8.1.
I want to have two voices in one staff.
The whole piece is witten in a-moll (a minor?), so there have to be 4
flats (b es as des)
if i want to enter an "es" in the second voice it prints an additional
flat-sign in front of it. why? there is already one flat-sign at the
beginning of the line. (but it seems that this is only used for the
first voice)

what am i doing wrong?

also, i'm looking for a way to add a header (title, komposer, etc.) to
the document.

Your discovery is strange, indeed. As a first workaround, you could
start with insertion of the additional flat. Later notes in the second
voice seem to get no additional flats. With the (whole staff) command
extras -> reduce accidentals you can clean it up. Maybe you can also
clean it up with extras -> set all to flats, which works only on a
selected region, which sometimes is what you want. This only as a fast
answer, maybe we have to dig more in it.

(And I think you meant another pitch, not a minor?)

Hi christoph,

sorry, but a minor (a-Moll) has no flats (and no sharps).

If you have 4 flats at the beginning of the line, then you want to insert just 
"e", that becomes "es" automatically (at least for me).

There is no menu "extras", but I found "Reduce Accidentals" under
"Tools". This works well as a workaround. Thanks.

Yes, of course. I meant A flat major. I'm used to use the german terms
and I'm a little confused by the english terms.

Subject: [Noteedit-user] repetition-sign (:||) not bar-aligned
Message-ID: <1149076581.8262.37.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hello,

The piece starts with an offbeat of one quarter. (3/4 time signature)
The repetition sign (and the final bar) ist after the second quarter and
before the third and last quarter of a bar.

Inserting the repetition sign after the second quarter works, but if I
continue after this sign, It behaves as if it is a complete new bar.

What I want is this: ("d" represents one quarter)
3/4  d|ddd|dd:||d|ddd|ddd|dd||

How can I realise this?

regards,
Christoph

Subject: [Noteedit-user] Lyrics spacing
Message-ID: <1149088223.8262.48.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hello,

I have another question:

Two staffs and attached to the first one, there are 4 lines of lyrics.
Via format->staff properties, I am able to adjust the distances between
the staffs and the lyrics, but the distance between the single lines of
lyrics is not adjustable. Currently the lyrics overlap.

Also the exported musixtex file produces a dvi, where the lyrics and the
second staff collide, but the distances between the lyrics are OK.

Is there an elegant way to adjust this or do I have to dive into the tex
file?

Christoph

No it shouldn't. If I do that, everyone get spammed quite quickly.
The list already suffers from large amounts spam and I don't want
that members get spam because they joined the list.

Good to hear that.

I haven't tried that up to now, so I can't tell if there's a
problem or if you did something wrong.

Hi,

again a crude workaround with hidden rests: With these you can stuff
every bar as a 3 beat bar, and in printout you get what you want. At
least in lilypond I got it. When listening to it, you hear the extra
rests, but I guess this is not disturbing. The hidden rest is the icon
after the triplet.

Regards,
Georg

I found another workaround:
I produced the music data using another program and exporeted/imported
it via musicxml. so noteedit is capable of displaying it.

There is no problem. I had a thinking error.
