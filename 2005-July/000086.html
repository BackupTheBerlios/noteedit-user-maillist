<PRE>I am using lilypond version 2.6 so my conversion reliability is 
sometimes compromised. My main interest is classical guitar notation, so 
I do alot of single staff polyphony. I hope that future versions of 
NoteEdit can become more complex notation oriented. Lilypond has 
recently included routines for guitar fingering notation. What would be 
really great is if  the NoteEdit gui could be split into a pure notation 
gui.

My NoteEdit 2.8 ./configure is --without libs.... as I have no need to 
hear midi of what I write and transcribe.

In future I hope that a pure notation editor without midi deps can be 
developed. NoteEdit seems like a good starting point. Maybe the way to 
go is to have a pared down notation gui which parses a .ly or whatever 
ouput script as you enter notes. The output script could then be edited 
on the fly.

I have not tried the ABC conversion yet as I do not have ABC configured 
in my slackware install.  I do not know how well ABC handles single 
staff polyphony, or whether or not it can parse fingerings. If anybody 
has any experience with this please clarify what ABC can and cannot do.

I know that the ability to output midi is important to many, but the 
ability to quickly and correctly notate music seems more important to 
me. Just my two cents... I do not mean this as a flame, and am really 
impressed with the progress you are making. Keep up the great work, if I 
was a compitant programmer I would help! I do not even know how to 
remove deps without breaking things yet.

Eric
