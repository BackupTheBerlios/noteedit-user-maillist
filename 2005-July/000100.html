<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>... There are 
</I>&gt;<i>a few things that I'm having a hard time doing in noteedit thought, and I was 
</I>&gt;<i>hoping someone could help me out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>1. after inserting notes into a staff I have a hard time figuring out how to 
</I>&gt;<i>add such things as staccatos, accents etc. to the notes already inserted. how 
</I>&gt;<i>does one do this? I know that I can select staccato before entering the note, 
</I>&gt;<i>however it seems more efficient to be able to highlight my selection after 
</I>&gt;<i>entering it and then adding accents and such. Am I missing something.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>Hi Art,

for adding accents afterwards you have to go in edit mode by pressing
the E button. For toggling the edit mode there is also a keyboard
shortcut, even configurable. And we have to mention that NoteEdit
currently only supports one kind of accent per note. And the (single)
note to be accented has to be selected.
&gt;<i>2. The Text feature does not seem to be quite as nice as in Rosegarden. and I 
</I>&gt;<i>do notice some mistakes. accel. and ritard. should be italicized when 
</I>&gt;<i>exported to lilypond. Are there ways to manually set what the text should 
</I>&gt;<i>look like, instead of just &quot;uptext&quot; and &quot;downtext&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>Not in NoteEdit. Maybe this should go on our whishlist? I missed
sometimes that lilypond by itself didn't choose the right distance in
heigth, so that the text woudn't interfere with the notes, .. seems for
me not so easily accessible for automation. Maybe for you it would be
worthwile to run a text processing script before lilypond?
&gt;<i>3. I'm not seeing any tools for entering crescendos or decrescendos. any help 
</I>&gt;<i>there would be great.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>This is somehow tricky: In either mode you choose in the menu
insert-&gt;lines, then you select for example dynamics. Then click on the
starting note where you want it, and you get a slider widget in the
right bottom of NoteEdit, where you can adjust the length and direction
of the dynamic. A click in the free area of NoteEdit enters everything.
Deleting needs to delete the leading note. A caveat: When exporting to
lilypond a dynamic can't stop on a rest. (Need to check the online help
if it's properly in there.)

Hope this helps you,
Regards,
Georg
