<PRE>I've been keeping ana eye on notation on linux for a while, and right now I'm 
liking both noteedit and rosegarden4 for their notation interfaces. There are 
a few things that I'm having a hard time doing in noteedit thought, and I was 
hoping someone could help me out.

1. after inserting notes into a staff I have a hard time figuring out how to 
add such things as staccatos, accents etc. to the notes already inserted. how 
does one do this? I know that I can select staccato before entering the note, 
however it seems more efficient to be able to highlight my selection after 
entering it and then adding accents and such. Am I missing something.

2. The Text feature does not seem to be quite as nice as in Rosegarden. and I 
do notice some mistakes. accel. and ritard. should be italicized when 
exported to lilypond. Are there ways to manually set what the text should 
look like, instead of just &quot;uptext&quot; and &quot;downtext&quot;?

3. I'm not seeing any tools for entering crescendos or decrescendos. any help 
there would be great.


There are some things about noteedit I like over Rosegarden. The score layout 
ability and the note entry system. navigating to the correct note and then 
entering it in is very helpful. Rosegarden4 has no support for layout issues, 
and implements a very silly solfege system for entering notes which would 
drive anyone nuts who hasn't taken sight singing classes. 

For me the rule of who dominates is which resulting lilypond file do I have to 
edit the least to get basic normal functionallity?

Thanks.
