Ups, I just saw that I had a conflict in exactly that file when
I redid a checkout. Strange, that it only hit me in the release
directory and not in my other one I used as a base for this one.
Also all the .svn directories are now deleted. Still the archive
seems to be a bit too large for me.

I'm on my way uploading a new beta-1 archive. Sorry for the accident.

Subject: [Noteedit-user] Noteedit 2.8.1 lilypond 2.4.2 fonts problem
Message-ID: <1745864132@web.de>

Hi,

I don?t know if this is a problem of noteedit or lilypond or what else. In the ".ps " or ".pdf"- output is an ugli font and the german "umlauts" are lacking. In the ".dvi" output the font is fine but the notes are incomplete.
Can anybody help me??

Thanks

Hi Manfred,

on Suse 9.3 I'm seeing almost the same problem. But the dvi-file is
perfect with xdvi. Maybe you're missing some TeX/Metafont-Package. Try
to install everything you need to compile lilypond in this area if
nothing helps. Is a simple lily sample file printing ok? I guess it's
not a noteedit problem. If I'm working on a song I use a small script,
actually a makefile, to invoke these programs in a row:

SONG = corelli
SONG = bowl_of
SONG = cantaloup_island
SONG = fantasie

all:
        lilypond $(SONG).ly
        dvips $(SONG).dvi
        ps2pdf $(SONG).ps
        acroread $(SONG).pdf

Exporting lyrics works on my system if I export in latin1 encoding.
NoteEdit seems to be very good in this area. Heard that lilypond plans
to support unicode in newer versions.
If you need more help, ask again on the list, there might be better
expertise available.
Regards,
Georg

Thanks for your advice,

now I can handle it with "dvips song.dvi" and I get a pretty ps-file with correct german "umlauts"

Yes, utf8 support is already supported since 2.5.6!

Subject: [Noteedit-user] Building NoteEdit on Qt/KDE platforms < 3.2
Message-ID: <4285E801.6060607@web.de>

Hi,

I just checked in a new version of the configure.in.in file
being the base file for the configure. If you are on an older
system, check it out and run "make -f Makefile.cvs" and you should
now be able to compile noteedit on your system as well.

To do this manually edit configure.in.in and change the first line
#MIN_CONFIG

to
#MIN_CONFIG(3.0.0)

Older versions of KDE and QT are no longer supported. If you need
NoteEdit for these platforms you have to stick with the 3.7.4 version.

Future releases than 2.8.0-b2 will contain a configure file for
the Qt/KDE version < 3.2.

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Hi, 

I installed the ec-fonts-mftraced_1.0.12-1_all.deb  from the lilypond site (www.lilypond.org/download/fonts) instead of the deb, which is in Sid and everything (pdf,ps and dvi-output) is fine.

greetings

Good! Updating with this package through alien didn't help here. Maybe
lilypond 2.4.5 is also needed, according to the lilypond-user archives,
because my Suse 9.3 lives on tetex 3.0.
Probably I'll stick with my little script for now.

Regards,
Georg.
