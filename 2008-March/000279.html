&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I used NoteEdit to write notes for a few short musical composition and
</I>&gt;<i> it produced really nice-looking results. Until today... I need to
</I>&gt;<i> prepare notes for a composition without constant measure (I mean that
</I>&gt;<i> measure/rythm is not important, as e.g. in Gregorian chants). The
</I>&gt;<i> measure bars are in fact used there to indicate end of phrase, not the
</I>&gt;<i> rythm. Unfortunately I couldn't find a way to save and restore it in
</I>&gt;<i> NoteEdit -- while saving it warned me that there are incorrect measures
</I>&gt;<i> and that &quot;MUP does not work&quot;, after opening the file the notes didn't
</I>&gt;<i> match the saved composition. Moreover output produced by lilypond was
</I>&gt;<i> incorrect, only abc produced valid output file, however it could not
</I>&gt;<i> handle UTF characters produced by NoteEdit in lyrics. I had to correct
</I>&gt;<i> them by hand to latin2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a method to write, save and restore such compositions using
</I>&gt;<i> NoteEdit? Did I miss something important?
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>Have been using noteedit for a couple of years, and as far as I know you
must have measures and time signature set for the app to save correctly.
It is even more important for exprot to lilypond.
It may be possible, however, to work around this by varying the tempo,
using the tempo change edit function. It is found under  &quot;insert&quot; in the
tool bar, and can be used to change the tempo several times within the
same measure.
Hope this helps. It's the best work around I know of.
