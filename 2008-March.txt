Subject: [Noteedit-user] Measure problem
Message-ID: <47D1907A.9070503@rzeszow.oaza.pl>

Hello,

I used NoteEdit to write notes for a few short musical composition and
it produced really nice-looking results. Until today... I need to
prepare notes for a composition without constant measure (I mean that
measure/rythm is not important, as e.g. in Gregorian chants). The
measure bars are in fact used there to indicate end of phrase, not the
rythm. Unfortunately I couldn't find a way to save and restore it in
NoteEdit -- while saving it warned me that there are incorrect measures
and that "MUP does not work", after opening the file the notes didn't
match the saved composition. Moreover output produced by lilypond was
incorrect, only abc produced valid output file, however it could not
handle UTF characters produced by NoteEdit in lyrics. I had to correct
them by hand to latin2.

Is there a method to write, save and restore such compositions using
NoteEdit? Did I miss something important?

Best regards,
Wojtek

Have been using noteedit for a couple of years, and as far as I know you
must have measures and time signature set for the app to save correctly.
It is even more important for exprot to lilypond.
It may be possible, however, to work around this by varying the tempo,
using the tempo change edit function. It is found under  "insert" in the
tool bar, and can be used to change the tempo several times within the
same measure.
Hope this helps. It's the best work around I know of.

Thank you for explanation. Unfortunately this workaround may be
acceptable to achieve some effect in resulting midi. But what I need is
a note typesetter application, not midi creator. So it is an important
shortcoming...

Yes, it definitely helps: I wont be looking once again in noteedit menus
for this non-existent feature  ;-) The question is: will I found a note
editor that lacks this fault?

Thanks again,

I have not seen an editor with the features you request, but the new
Canorus project might be open to suggestions. Wouldn't hurt to let them
know what features you desire.
Find them here:  https://canorus.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Main_Page and
click "feature requests."

Thank you very much! I'll give it a try ;-)

Hi!

My name is Chuck, and I'm very interested in NoteEdit as a way to create scores and compose music on Linux.

I do have one question - I hope it hasn't been asked a million times already!

WhenI'm entering notes, and I hit (for instance) the Fermata button, thenext note I get has the Fermata attached.  But how do I turn that backoff again for future notes?  I can't figure it out.

Thank you, in advance, for your advice!

Hi Chuck!

After you've entered the note with the Fermata, it should work to
simply click the fermata button again to turn it off.

Thank you so much for replying!

When I click the "Fermata" button a second time, the new notes I enter still have a "Fermata" attached to them.  It makes no difference whether I change the duration of the notes either.  I can't get it to turn off no matter what I do.

When I click "About" I get "NoteEdit 2.8.1 (Using KDE 3.5.1 Leve 'a" SUSE 10.1"

I am unable to reproduce your issue, but I'm using a slightly newer
KDE (same NoteEdit though)...I doubt that has anything to do with it
though. My exact process is as follows:

Click on note duration -> Click on Fermata sign -> Place note on staff
-> Click Fermata sign again -> continue placing notes.

If that's not working at all, a possible work around would be to do
the following:

Click on note duration -> Click on Fermata sign -> Place note on staff
-> Press 'e' to enter edit mode -> Click a blank spot on staff (not
actually editing anything) -> Press Esc to clear out of edit mode ->
Select note duration and place normal note.

Seems kind of roundabout, I know, but it worked for me.

Let us know how it comes out...
