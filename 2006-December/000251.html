<PRE>Hi,

I'm really enjoying Noteedit.  Thanks for all of your work.  I'm running 
2.8.1 on Ubuntu Dapper (using Gnome) but I have KDE libraries installed 
and things seem to be working pretty well.

I'd be grateful for info about any (or all) of the following problems:

Beaming:

I have set my staff to 4/4. I am trying to enter a half rest, 8th rest 
and then 3 8th notes.  I want the 2nd two 8th notes beamed but I want 
the first to stand on its own. If I simply enter 3 8th notes, they all 
get beamed together. If I enter the first two 8th notes (upbeat of 3 and 
downbeat of 4) and then I hit Backspace they are un-beamed, but then 
when I enter the 3rd 8th note they all get beamed again. I've tried 
various combinations of using Backspace and clicking the Beam button on 
the tool bar but so far have not been able to achieve what I want.  I 
also tried marking the two 8th notes that I want to un-beam as a block 
and then clicking the Beam button a couple of times. Nothing seems to 
change.  I could probably edit the exported file, but if it's possible 
to do this in Noteedit, I'd love to know.

I think the answer might be Edit &gt; AutoBeam...but I don't see a way of 
indicating how many notes I want automatically beamed.

Custom Chords:

I'm creating leadsheets for use in a jazz context. I would like to enter 
chord changes and I would like these changes to transpose when I 
transpose the piece.  For this reason I don't want to enter the chords 
as arbitrary text.  At the top of the Insert &gt; Chord dialog there is a 
text box that looks like it might be a place to enter a custom chord 
symbol.  For example, I would like to be able to enter &quot;B-7b5&quot; or 
&quot;F#7+9&quot;.  Is there a way to do this? 

Editing:

I went to edit mode to change a measure in the middle of the piece.  
Somehow I ended up with a bar of 4.5 beats: 8th rest followed by 8 8th 
notes.  The only way I was able to fix this was to delete all of the bar 
(did Undo several times) after the offending measure, re-enter the bad 
measure and then reenter the rest of the piece.  Is there a better way I 
could have done that? Is there a way to get Noteedit to recalculate the 
measures and correct the bars?


Thank you very much for your time.

Brian
