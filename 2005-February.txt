Subject: [Noteedit-user] 2.7.4 Beta 1 released
Message-ID: <42054959.10907@web.de>

Hi,

The first beta (and probably the last and also the first and last 
release candidate ;-) for version 2.7.4 of noteedit has been released. 
Please test this hard and report any build problems to the developer 
mailing lists. You can also post bugs to the bug tracker.

You can download it from here:
http://developer.berlios.de/project/filelist.php?group_id=2232

I only know of one issue: The problem reports are still send
to Joerg Anders.

Regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Hi!

I've uploaded a first version of the new noteedit homepage. It
can be visited here: http://noteedit.berlios.de
Currently it is very simple and only based on the README.

It is also checked in into SVN. So you can send in your
patches or add your comments. We should have a designer
improving the homepage. Some ideas have already been
posted to the list beginning on 22. September (see ML Archives).

Also the homepage of Mr. Anders seems to be lost in the
happy hunting ground of some memory chips... I got some of
the original files (without screenshots) in case someone
wants to copy some of the original content.

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Hi,

I m a poor NoteEdit user under Debian Sarge I use NoteEdit 2.7.1
Where can I get help?

I try to write some music for guitar (classical) and share it on this 
great forum (http://delcamp.net),
 and I don't know how to insert some quarter of silence.
I read the help, but  found  nothing about silence.

Thanks

Georges

Try to use not the left but the right button of your mouse.

And if you don't want the rest being visible (but being there), you can 
turn the hidden-rest button on in the toolbar (crossed over quarter rest 
icon) and use the right mouse button.

Hi Georges,

this is fixed for the upcoming 2.7.4 release, only together with 
lilypond 2.4 and above. Hope this  works for you. All _8 and ^8 
combinations for all clefs I'll add after this release, I think.

Pity that noteedit doesn't have that yet. It's needed. Deserves a 
feature request.

Huh, this might need the help of a guru, hmm.

Hi Georg,

thanks for creating our first official release.

Did you do any advertising yet ?

E.g. http://freshmeat.net/projects/noteedit/ is still outdated, 
www.kde-apps.org is unreachable at the moment, don't know it's status. An 
announcement to a mailing list (comp.os.linux.audio ?) might be useful too.

Regards, Leon.

Best Regards,

Thanks. As I gave up reading LAU etc. I won't make any announcements myself. 
Wouldn't even know how to do that :-).
