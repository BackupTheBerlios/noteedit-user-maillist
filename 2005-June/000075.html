<PRE>This is the release candidate in the release cycle of the coming 2.8.0 
release of NoteEdit.
If you still find bugs post them in the Bug tracker. or mail them to the 
developer mailing list.
Known bugs can be found in the Bug tracker as well.

Since now, we were successfully maintaining the original English, German 
(most of NE developers), Slovenian (myself) and Slovakian (Zdenko 
Podobn&#253;) translation. However, we did not recieve any progress report or 
confirmation about the translations to other languages.
Let me remind you that the deadline to commit the translation files is 
on Sunday, 12th June 2005, 23:59 CET.
Translations not being sent until Sunday will not make it to the stable 
2.8.0 version.

Please contact us immediately if you're making or going to make the 
translation work for your language. If we won't recieve a confirmation 
within 48 hours, we will assume that this message didn't reach
you and we'll start to search for another translators.
