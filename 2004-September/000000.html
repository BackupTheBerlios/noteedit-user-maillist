<PRE>Hi!

As a first time user you will probably come along the questions how to
print from noteedit. I had the same question when using noteedit.
Currently the answer is simple: There is no printing possible with
noteedit. But this weakness has also it's strength: Noteedit offers
several great export modules for programs or tools being able to
print the score in a manner noteedit probably would never achieve
itself. These are currently pmx, musixtex, lilypond, abc and finally
musicxml for programs that support import of this format.
Many of these tools rely on TeX as a base. On most linux distributions
you simply will have to install a tetex package to use the tools.
I personally use lilypond since some months for printing as it has a
very good font and score design. Also it is very easy to create a pdf
or postscript file from the exported file.

Midi is the other big part you will certainly encounter when using
noteedit. Currently tse3 is required for useful midi playing and
recording using noteedit. You can also import or export midi files
created with other programs. If you have a cheap soundcard like I
have you probably want to use timidity as a midi server for playing
the midi file and the soundserver jack (similar to but much better
than arts or esd (esound)) for connecting noteedit and timidity to
your soundcard.

Best regards,
