Message-ID: <6b0a17e004111620555d96215e@mail.gmail.com>

I have a couple of friends who aren't quite ready or able to switch to
Linux, and I'm looking for a LiveCD (Knoppix, Mepis, Morphix, DSL
etc.) that includes noteedit so I don't have people at my house half
the night borrowing my computer to typeset their music.

Hi Barry,

the Suse 9.1 Live-CD Audio Edition had noteedit with it for shure, if 
you can find it on the net. A good try might be a new 9.2 live-DVD/CD 
instead.
Regards,
Georg.

No luck on 9.2 LiveCD.  Maybe I'll look around and see if I can find a 9.1

Thanks,
Barry
