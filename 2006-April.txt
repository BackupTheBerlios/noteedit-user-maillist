stanza-editor?

hol- le- ri, hol- le- ro. Was<repeat />

Hi,

the solution you have to use is a little crude: NoteEdit knows only
lyrics without repeats. As such they are exported to lilypond. When you
want to attach a repeat with lyrics, you have to use the next stanza as
a whole, fill up the unused lyrics with under quotes. To make it more
beautiful you can later edit the stanza markings in the .ly file.

Hopefully I understood your issue,
Georg

Hi,
thanks for your help. You had understood my issue. That's not easy by my 
english. 

My problem is unfixed. Its working good now. At finally, I have a question to 
lilypond. How can I use figures (as 1,2,3,...) or special characters (as 
+,&,...) in stanza lyrics? I read, that isn't supported by lilypond. 

Bye and best regards
Bj?rn

Hello NoteEdit enthusiast,

On Friday 28.04.06 at 15.00 will be a NoteEdit workshop
at the LAC (Linux Audio Conference) in Karlsruhe/ZKM.

The LAC is streamed into the internet (probably excluding
some workshops as they run in parallel on that day). Here
an exctract of the official announcement:

the linux audio conference 2006, which takes place at the zkm in karlsruhe/germany from
april 27 to april 30, will be streamed live for your convenience, inspiration and enjoyment.

all presentations (which are listed on http://lac.zkm.de/2006/program.shtml) are covered as
ogg vorbis audio streams...

...the stream urls are listed at http://lac.zkm.de/2006/streaming.shtml.

there will be chat channels to go with the streams, where you can report problems, discuss the
presentations and also ask questions which will be relayed to the live audience by the local chat
operators here at zkm. these channels are #lac2006 for general issues and chitchat, and
#lac2006-track1 and #lac2006-track2 for questions and remarks about the current presentation, all
