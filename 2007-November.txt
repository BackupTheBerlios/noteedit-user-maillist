Subject: [Noteedit-user] Reminder: LAC 2008 in Cologne
Message-ID: <474EA15C.8070406@web.de>

Hi,

I just quick point you to the upcoming LAC 2008 in Cologne, germany:
http://lac.linuxaudio.org.

As you see paper submission deadline is tomorrow at midnight. I did not
intend to write papers. I hope I will able to attend the conference (i.e.
I will do anything possible to make it happen).

I planned as this year to make a Canorus workshop with Matevz and (if he wishes
to)Georg. Any other one wanting to participate is most welcome! Up to now it is
not possible to directly announce a workshop for the conference. Maybe this is
done by submitting a paper, but I couldn't find any hint for that on the LAC page.

Best,

Reinhard
