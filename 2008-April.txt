Hi All,

I sent this letter out on the Canorus-user mailinglist as well, but I
wanted to make sure everyone was able to hear about a
 a site I put up not long ago called LinuxMusicians.Com. It's just a
forum where us musicians can get together and discuss creating music
on Linux, what apps we like/dislike, share our recordings and scores,
and generally just have a good time! I'd love it if you all would stop
by and check it out...we don't have very many members or posts right
now, but I think this could be a really exciting community!

Find it at http://linuxmusicians.com

Take care,

Nathan
