Subject: [Noteedit-user] NoteEdit from terminal
Message-ID: <1113327205.7694.1.camel@ubuntu.midominio>

       Hello list. I've been looking for some documentation about how to
execute NoteEdit from terminal, but I don't find anything. In "man
noteedit" there are some options to execute some characteristics from
terminal, but it's not enough.

       My idea is to import a midi file and show the score. I know
NoteEdit
does it bye Tse3, but I woudl like to know how to do it from terminal.

       Does anyone have any information about commands with NoteEdit?

       Thank you very much.

You can invoke a help using the command line:
noteedit --help

Importing via command line is currently not supported. Just write a
feature request if you wish to have it added (mainly so we developers
do not forget this wish 8-).

The command line help shows all available commands via command line.
I don't know if noteedit was ever intentioned to be used as a tool
invoked via command line. Of course loading not-files via command
line is not a problem, but I have some problems with automatic export
as there are no further options. Probably only the saved settings are
used for converting a not-file.

Best regards,

	Ok. Thank you very much. 

	It's a shame NoteEdit can not be used from command line... :-( I'd have
liked to import midi files to NoteEdit from my code... I'll tell
developers then.

Hi,
ann
On Friday the 22. April (Tomorrow) I and Georg will hold
an BOFS for noteedit. We will present noteedit to the
interested audience and discuss the current development
progress.

We already collected and discussed some ideas:
- Macros for noteedit making it easier to enter groups
   of notes (somewhat based on feature request #518/519)
- Improve midi input (manual edit mode), can be combined
   with the macros

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzm

Oh well, I forgot the time and the place:
LAC2005 is in Karlsruhe (http://lac.zkm.de)
and the BOFS is at 15.30.
The conference is streamed. See http://lac2005.zkm.de/
for more information.

Thanks and best regards,

Message-ID: <426C09EE.5030104@web.de>

Hi,

at the NoteEdit BOFS on Friday we've met two composers and the
lilypond authors. We talked about different topics concerning the use of
NoteEdit.

I showed some of the changes currently under development, namely the
integration of the voices and the staff properties dialog and some
improvements to the menu structure.

Georg talked about the improved lilypond integration in the current
version of NoteEdit and some of the problems that have been removed.

In the name of the NoteEdit team I want thank the organisators of the
LAC 2005 for the very good and professional organisation of the whole
conference. We could collect many ideas and had several discussions on
the future and the value of NoteEdit.

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann
