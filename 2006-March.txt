Can Noteedit be installed on OSX?

I have been trying to do this for a while now, without
much success. I am using KDE and Qt from the Fink
project. For now this requires compiling NoteEdit with
gcc 3; at some point in the future the 10.4 branch of
fink will be released, which will use gcc 4.

I did manage to get NoteEdit running on OSX 10.3,
although it was too buggy to be usable, probably since
I compiled it without the TSE3 library (configure
--without-libs). On 10.4, I get multiply-defined
symbol errors when linking. This happens when I try to
compile the TSE library as well.

The Fink website has some info and workarounds for
these errors, but I have unfortunately not gotten them
to work; even when I manage to suppress the errors
(export LDFLAGS="-multiply_defined suppress"), the
executable or library gives undefined symbol errors
when run. I have a feeling there is a fairly simple
fix for this problem, like giving gcc some certain
options, but at the moment I haven't discovered it :(
If you figure something out, post it!

Cheers,
Sam Hernandez

Probably yes, though I haven't tried it (I don't own
MacOSX). NoteEdit requires KDE3/Qt3 and should be
compiled with a recent gcc compiler (3.x/4.x), others
haven't been tested. Also I've read that tse3 won't
work on MacOSX, so you could try the kmid midi support.
If you have problems with compiling or linking, you can
post them here.

Good luck,

Reinhard

Hi,

For those who haven't already read it:
There was a really great article comparing the Lilypond
frontends Denemo, NoteEdit and Rosegarden by Dave Phillips.
NoteEdit got a very good review I'm really happy about!

Read the full article here:

A big thanks to Dave Phillips for the reviews!

Hi all score editing freaks out there,

I'm thinking about a link page for NoteEdit. It could contains
links to other score editors (denemo, rosegarden, but probably
primilary the backends of NoteEdit Lilypond, MusiXTeX, ABC etc.)

It should also contains places where you can get score written
in either the NoteEdit format (.not) or one of the backends
(including Midi and MusiXTeX).

The most important thing is: It should mainly contains free
music scores (public domain / gnu document license or similar).

I start a small list I have in my mind:
- http://icking-music-archive.org (both sheets and musixtex, pmx)
- http://www.mutopia.org (lilypond and midi sheets)
- http://www.lilypond.org
- http://moinejf.free.fr (abcm2ps - program to convert abc to ps)
- http://www.concertina.net (several free abc tunes)
- http://staffweb.cms.gre.ac.uk/~c.walshaw/abc/ (abc home page)

I'd be very happy to collect more pages you encountered. This
can also be forum pages containing composing tips or similar.
Thanks and best regards,

Reinhard

A new stable branch of LilyPond music typesetter was released this
weekend, 2.8.0. I hope the NoteEdit export filter needs to remain
unchanged and is still working for the new version.

You can get it at
http://www.lilypond.org

Hi all,
I've only just joined this list. I really like the relative simplicity of
noteedit.
Now that I've said that, I have had an opportunity to work with Lilypond
2.8.0 and I think the format is significantly different in some regards.
There are new methods of creating hyphen and extension marks on lyrics.
Also, in my experience, lilypond 2.8.0 won't work unless the ly file labels
itself as version 2.8.0.
Sorry I don't remember more, but this is just what I've been going through
at home this past weekend and I'm at work now.

Thanks,
Jonathan

Yes, lyrics code is different in NoteEdit any LilyPond. Actually
NoteEdit doesn't actually support melismas and multi-sillable words well
yet. That's the reason why in NoteEdit, you usually use
Twin- kle, Twin- kle, lit- tle star.
and in Lily
Twin -- kle, Twin -- kle, lit -- tle star.

The export filter isn't perfect about this. These are the major
differences about the two. Otherwise, it should work AFAIK. Is there any
specific problem you had in mind?

I can't say I have any other problems specifically. I just learned about
the convert-ly script that comes with lilypond and it did a nice job of
converting the noteedit output to something it could use. lilypond 2.8.0
is ever so particular about having that version number. 
I do have a question and/or an idea but I'll put those in a different
email so as to not abuse the subject.
