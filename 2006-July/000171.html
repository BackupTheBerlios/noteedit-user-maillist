<PRE>Hello,
I'm new here in the list, and I'm a newbe on LINUX - 1 year experience on Redhat9 and SuSE 9.2. 
My system now is SuSE 10.1 on a AMD Sempron3000+ - machine. 
Installed libtse3 is ver.0.3.1

I'm a programmer of a brilliant Multimedia-Midi-sequencer for the Commodore AMIGA computers and it's clones(AROS,MorphOS and OS4). Also I tried a port to JAVA (much incomplete yet). I'm a studied church musician.

Today I could compile and install NoteEdit complete ... but with some problems I had to solve:

1. the &quot;config&quot; couldn't recognize the libtse3, which is placed in /user/lib. Also not with the option --with-libtse3-libs=/opt/lib.

2. the tse3-includes where not available on the SuSE 10.1 Install-DVD, so I installed them by hand to /opt/kde3/include/tse3 from the archive from the tse-site.

3. To ensure configure doesn't break I added these two lines after line 31612
lib_libtse3=/usr/lib
inc_libtse3=/opt/kde3/include/tse3

4. I deinstalled the version 2.8.1, which came with SuSE 10.1, because in this compilation the keyboard doesn't work.

5. 'make' and 'make install' worked with some warnings (mostly the well know cast-warnings), but without to break.

6. Configured new the KDE-menu-entry for NoteEdit (example: the icons were in another dir in SuSE 10.1 from the previous installation).

Now all works OK (as far as I could see ... up to now), but when I press F1, the Help doesn't start. From the central SuSE-Help I can call the Help for NoteEdit.
Is it possible to solve this ?

At last: NoteEdit is a very impressive good Notation Editor. Sure, at the beginning (like in each program) the most time is needed to read the very good made manual.

If someone have had worked with programs like Finale or Sibelius before, some new things must be learned. But don't complain about missing features ... read the manual complete. Anything is not so comfortable, like in Finale or Sibelius, but NoteEdit is Freeware, and the commercials, like Finale or Sibelius are very expensive, and the result (on the printed sheets) is not so much better.

I congratulate the developers for this real good program, and I can guess how much efforts are neccessary, to make such a good program. Keep on your good work.

Kindly
Alfred
