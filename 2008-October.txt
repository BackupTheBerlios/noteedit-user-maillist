Subject: [Noteedit-user] N-Tupels
Message-ID: <48FF4C41.7080204@freenet.de>

Hello,

I am trying to write quintuples (is this the right expression?) with 
noteedit. It works basically fine with the N-Tuplets feature, but it 
interferes with the bar-measurement. In a 4/4 after inserting 2 
quintuples of eighths (=2 quarter), when  I try to insert a third one 
(first inserting 5 eights, total length now  9/8) noteedit breaks the 
bar and doesn't allow to reorganize the last five notes to a quintuple.

Hope that's somehow understandable :-)
Daniel.
