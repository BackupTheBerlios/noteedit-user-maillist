I am not familiar with kubuntu. Will it use RPM,s? If not, and if you
can't something specifically for kubuntu, you may have to build from source.
Wish I could be more help, but I'm just learning myself. I only
responded because I haven't seen much activity on this list lately.

Ubuntu Edgy already includes NoteEdit-2.8.1 in universe repository.
Change your sources in /etc/apt/sources.list to edgy and NoteEdit will
upgrade itself.

If you don't want to upgrade the whole system, only switch repository to
edgy and upgrade NoteEdit without the whole system upgrade. It should
work fine.

But the edgy-noteedit will require some edgy-version-libraries.
And these libraries will require other libraries to be a newer version.

You are lucky that I have compiled ne-2.8.1-rc1 some time ago and
installed it using checkinstall. During the install, there was a .deb
generated. I put it on my webspace for you
http://www.pisi.de/noteedit-2.8.1-rc_2.8.1-rc-1_i386.deb .

It depends on libtse3.
dapper contains libtse3-0.3.1, but my deb is linked against 0.2.7.
The following command helps if it complains about not finding
libtse3-0.2.7 and you have the 0.3.1-er version installed)

sudo ln -s  /usr/lib/libtse3-0.3.1.so /usr/lib/libtse3-0.2.7.so

Let me know if it helps.

Christoph

Unfortunately this did not work.

Alas, I managed to compile it from source, and thanks to your suggestion i 
used checkinstall to make my own .deb !

But there is one thing which really bugs me right now:
I seem to have lost "Print" and "Print Preview" from the "File" Menu.
I know the two items were there yesterday when I first compiled and tested it, 
but now they are gone. (and yes, lilypond is installed and is detected during 
noteedit startup)

Anyone knows what could be the reason to this mystery ?

Thanks,
Karl

Printing works fine when I press CTRL-P
Is there a keyboard-shortcut for the print-preview ?

Weird?
Cheers,
Karl

There is neither "Print" nor "Print Preview" in the "File" Menu of my
version.

Maybe this is a KDE option.
But I'm not familiar with KDE.

Hehehe, i figured it out !
You have to remove the original noteedit 2.8.0 package from your distribution.

Apparently there is some problem with having both versions installed, you will 
notice that the splash screen shows 2.8.0 when both are installed, but 2.8.1 
when you install only 2.8.1, and it also hides the Print items from the file 
menu.

Now the reason i had the original package still installed is that the help is 
not working in 2.8.1. Anyone know how to get the manual working in 2.8.1 ?
Or alternatively how to get the help html files out of 2.8.0 ?

Thanks,
Karl

In my distribution (SUSE 10.1) the handbook is in the KDE help center, which 
NoteEdit links to from the help menu. This can be accessed from the KDE help 
center by search for "noteedit".

Or, use the Handbook at:  http://noteedit.berlios.de/doc/index.html

Sorry if this is late info. I am having trouble with my mail, and had to pull 
your question from the archives.
