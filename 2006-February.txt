My name is Emilio Procaccini. I lives in Fabriano (An) Italy where i teach 
piano and young orchestra in a middle school. Synce  few years i make all my 
arrangements by notation software. I beginned with finale 2000 and now, after 
i discovered gnu-linux and open-source, i am enjoing to work with noteedit. 
After 2.7 versions, now i try to work with 2.8.0.2. It's very good, but i 
have problems if i try to upgrade the kde's software  and  libraries, 
specially if i move from kdelibs4c2a 4:3.4.3-2 to 4:3.5.0-3: "del" key and 
others no make effect. Is it usual ? If you have  time to answer me, i really 
enjoi.
Many many regards  and thank for your work.

Hello,

The keyboard shortcuts doesn't work for me too.
With a previous version of Noteedit, it worked good.

I posted this "bug" in the Noteedit berlios.de page. Perhaps I shouldn't.
https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=6263&group_id=2232

I don't understand what do you mean exactly. What do I have to check more 
precisely ?

I use a Debian unstable, with Noteedit 2.8.0.

Thank you

I have no KDE, but I have kconfig installed to configure KDE programs.

It seems that:
- your KDE keyboard configurations are wrong;
	and/or:
- your X configurations is wrong.

For kde, run kconfig (KDE Control Center) and check/try with keyboard 
options.

For X, I don't know if you use xorg or xfree86. The command (as root!) 
can be one from:

dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfreee86
dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg (I am not sure, I use xfree86)

For console, if there are also problems with it, should be:

kbdconfig

Hi Emilio!

Confirmed, I also have problem with keys using Debian's NoteEdit 2.8.0-2
and TSE3 0.3.1-4. However, using the latest SVN version, I didn't
encounter the problem (maybe I was still using KDE 3.4 before??). I'll
dig into it and try to figure something out. We already have some
findings from Adam:

I'll look at it.

Btw, I'm using Debian unstable, KDE 3.5, Xorg and Linux kernel 2.6.15.1.


Regards.

Hi,

A hint which might solve the keyboard problem was posted on the
developer mailing list
(http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/noteedit-devel/2006-January/000593.html).

I myself don't have kde installed so I can't help you much with
hints how to solve the problem. The 3.4.2 KDE kcontrol has
possibilities to change keyboard shortcuts (Accessibility->Keyboard
Shortcuts). Maybe changing the something in the application
shortcut tab helps as well.

Regards,

Reinhard

Thank you very much.

I use Debian unstable, so I downloaded the source package, I patched the wrong 
line by hand, then I rebuilt the package :

apt-get source noteedit
cd noteedit-2.8.0
fakeroot dpkg-buildpackage
cd ..
su -c dpkg -i noteedit*.deb

It works great now.

How can I compile noteedit in the Mac OS 10.4?
