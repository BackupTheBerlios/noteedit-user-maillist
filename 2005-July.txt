Message-ID: <42CC216A.20600@telus.net>

I am using lilypond version 2.6 so my conversion reliability is 
sometimes compromised. My main interest is classical guitar notation, so 
I do alot of single staff polyphony. I hope that future versions of 
NoteEdit can become more complex notation oriented. Lilypond has 
recently included routines for guitar fingering notation. What would be 
really great is if  the NoteEdit gui could be split into a pure notation 
gui.

My NoteEdit 2.8 ./configure is --without libs.... as I have no need to 
hear midi of what I write and transcribe.

In future I hope that a pure notation editor without midi deps can be 
developed. NoteEdit seems like a good starting point. Maybe the way to 
go is to have a pared down notation gui which parses a .ly or whatever 
ouput script as you enter notes. The output script could then be edited 
on the fly.

I have not tried the ABC conversion yet as I do not have ABC configured 
in my slackware install.  I do not know how well ABC handles single 
staff polyphony, or whether or not it can parse fingerings. If anybody 
has any experience with this please clarify what ABC can and cannot do.

I know that the ability to output midi is important to many, but the 
ability to quickly and correctly notate music seems more important to 
me. Just my two cents... I do not mean this as a flame, and am really 
impressed with the progress you are making. Keep up the great work, if I 
was a compitant programmer I would help! I do not even know how to 
remove deps without breaking things yet.

Hello list!

On this thread I wrote once about problems with noteedit and midi output. 
Today I gave it a new try, and what do I see? It works! It came from nowhere 
and it played everything, I gave him to play. I did nothing, and suddenly it 
works.
I do thank everyone who answered my mails so paitently!

Now my weekend cannot become bad, and I just have to cope with the printing of 
the notes.

Thanks a bundle

Kai

No I'm afraid there is only a german and english documentation a little
bit out of date compared to 2.8.0. My french is quite rusty and also I
prefer to work on developing new features for the program instead of
translating the documentation to french. Maybe someone else would like
to take the challenge to translate it. Also the french translation is
not up to date as our current french translator did not answer when we
asked if it is possible for him to do that. We still hope to finish 
french translation soon though and will announce it to the lists if
it is done.

If you know anyone who speaks english or german a little bit better and 
knows the music technical terms we would be very thankful for a start of
a french documentation (the first introduction chapters would probably
be enough as a start).

Thanks for your feedback.

Regards,

Reinhard

Thanks for your feedback :-). I'm glad to here that midi output works 
for you!

Well in that area noteedit will improve further soon hopefully as 
promised :-).

Concerning midi playing: If anyone uses fluidsynth / qsynth (or whatever
frontend you use for it), I can tell you that I was able to reduce the
memory amount needed drastically by updating to the latest versions and
using 48 Khz Sampling rate instead of 96 Khz for the output. So I can 
really recommand it for those having 512 MB RAM like me.

Eric,

I am also using NoteEdit for transcribing classical guitar music. ABC does not 
handle polyphony, but abcm2ps does. NoteEdit's abc output is compatible with 
abcm2ps, i.e. when you use multiple voices in a staff, the resulting abc file 
is polyphonic and needs abcm2ps for printing. This works very well. Don't 
know about fingering, though.

Best regards, Leon.

Hi Jean,

to help you we might need more info. Anyway, I what comes to my mind:

1) There's no hint what at all causes the problem, so you could post a
snippet of music (.not or .ly) to the list. We could check if we can
print it. Generally, there are no overall problem, more singular
problems in details.

2) Your lily version seems to be out of date. A stable version, 2.6.1,
would be recommended.

3) If it turns out to be a NoteEdit problem, we would fix it for the
stable versions lilypond 2.4.x and 2.6.

Recently I updated the neccessary packages on my machine for lilypond
and got a working 2.6.1. It seems to be very compatible with NoteEdit
2.8.0, which exports in lilypond 2.4.2 style. A problem arises in
special characters of lyrics and titles. The now partially missing
backend of TeX needs different encondings now for texts, preferably
latin1. But lilypond doesn't chocke on those, instead, makes it as
beatifull as it can :)

If your problem pushes the lilypond 2.6 adaption, that would be only
good ...

Best Regards,
Georg

Hello Jean,

everything is okay, if you export in NoteEdit with lyrics encoding
latin1, not ascii, what you did probably (in the lilypond export
dialog). I checked it with NoteEdit 2.8.0 and both lilypond 2.4.4 and 2.6.1.

Btw., why exporting with utf8 is not working I'm going to check out now ...

Tell if you see still a problem. I enjoyed to listen to your music,
Best Regards,

Georg.

Subject: [Noteedit-user] need help on tips.
Message-ID: <200507240134.51977.arthur.moore.lists@gmail.com>

I've been keeping ana eye on notation on linux for a while, and right now I'm 
liking both noteedit and rosegarden4 for their notation interfaces. There are 
a few things that I'm having a hard time doing in noteedit thought, and I was 
hoping someone could help me out.

1. after inserting notes into a staff I have a hard time figuring out how to 
add such things as staccatos, accents etc. to the notes already inserted. how 
does one do this? I know that I can select staccato before entering the note, 
however it seems more efficient to be able to highlight my selection after 
entering it and then adding accents and such. Am I missing something.

2. The Text feature does not seem to be quite as nice as in Rosegarden. and I 
do notice some mistakes. accel. and ritard. should be italicized when 
exported to lilypond. Are there ways to manually set what the text should 
look like, instead of just "uptext" and "downtext"?

3. I'm not seeing any tools for entering crescendos or decrescendos. any help 
there would be great.


There are some things about noteedit I like over Rosegarden. The score layout 
ability and the note entry system. navigating to the correct note and then 
entering it in is very helpful. Rosegarden4 has no support for layout issues, 
and implements a very silly solfege system for entering notes which would 
drive anyone nuts who hasn't taken sight singing classes. 

For me the rule of who dominates is which resulting lilypond file do I have to 
edit the least to get basic normal functionallity?

Thanks.

Hi!

I looked at them and found out that you're not using the latest
version of NoteEdit (<2.7.4). There are many LilyPond export
improvements made in 2.7.4 and 2.8.0, so I advice you to update to the
latest version of NE. I opened the .not file and fix some spacings
(using underspace/overspace so the lyrics doesn't hit the staff) and
simply export it to LilyPond. And then:

matevz at mojazver:~/tmp$ convert-ly --edit Anonyme_jaiunmari_4vx.ly
/usr/bin/convert-ly (GNU LilyPond) 2.4.5
Processing `Anonyme_jaiunmari_4vx.ly' ... Applying conversions:

It worked out of the box. I'm attaching the results.

About your problem, I think there's something with your LilyPond
installation messed up. Did you install libguile library (or
everything related to guile) beside the LilyPond? If that doesn't
help, contact the user mailing list at LilyPond
(lilypond-user at gnu.org) and the maintainer for Mandrake.

For the version of LilyPond, you should simply run lilypond --version
and it should print the LilyPond version out.

Hi Art,

for adding accents afterwards you have to go in edit mode by pressing
the E button. For toggling the edit mode there is also a keyboard
shortcut, even configurable. And we have to mention that NoteEdit
currently only supports one kind of accent per note. And the (single)
note to be accented has to be selected.

Not in NoteEdit. Maybe this should go on our whishlist? I missed
sometimes that lilypond by itself didn't choose the right distance in
heigth, so that the text woudn't interfere with the notes, .. seems for
me not so easily accessible for automation. Maybe for you it would be
worthwile to run a text processing script before lilypond?
>3. I'm not seeing any tools for entering crescendos or decrescendos. any help

This is somehow tricky: In either mode you choose in the menu
insert->lines, then you select for example dynamics. Then click on the
starting note where you want it, and you get a slider widget in the
right bottom of NoteEdit, where you can adjust the length and direction
of the dynamic. A click in the free area of NoteEdit enters everything.
Deleting needs to delete the leading note. A caveat: When exporting to
lilypond a dynamic can't stop on a rest. (Need to check the online help
if it's properly in there.)

Hope this helps you,
Regards,
Georg

It's me again..
Perhaps I should have posted the line where the failure is reported. It's in 
the 32nd line:

     25 staff 4
     26 // overlength = 60
     27 // underlength = 60
     28 // lyricsdist = 60
     29 ?       clef=bass
     30 ?       key = 3&
     31 music
     32 midi 1 1: 0 "channel=1"; 0 "program=0";
     33 midi 2 1: 0 "channel=3"; 0 "program=0";

The other error (line 161) was an error corresponding to a double bar. I found 
the solution through google.

Best regards.

Kai

Mandriva has only 2.7.4 currently in it's archive (I don't know if it 
was included with Mandriva LE 2005). On the Mandriva homepage you
can find mirrors where you can download it (cooker link).
Else you need to download the source and compile it yourself (works
fine on my Mandriva LE2005 box). I could upload Mandriva RPM and SRPM if 
this is too technical for you at the weekend (my RPM might not work
on your older Mandrake box).

Hi,

./configure seems to fail to ebrace my gcc.

Check your compiler installation or

NoteEdit 2.8.0 cannot compile (and was not meant to) with gcc4. The
problems are the syntax errors in TSE3 headers (which need to be
compiled if you want to have playback). However, a user confirmed that
building of NoteEdti with gcc4 was successful for him. Test the latest
trunk SVN version.

Subject: [Noteedit-user] noteedit-2.7.4 on DeMuDi - print preview problem
Message-ID: <42E9584C.4070902@yahoo.com.br>

Hi all,

I have some problems with noteedit-2.7.4 *print preview* :

0. NoteEdit cannot find abcm2ps under certain ciscustances (when 
noteedit is called from a terminal; no problem when called from a 
mini-command (fbrun)); the printing is cancelled at all.

ErrMsg: "abcm2ps was not found in your PATH, aborting"

localhost  hudson $ which abcm2ps
/usr/local/bin/abcm2ps

localhost  hudson $ echo $PATH
/home/hudson/bin:/home/hudson/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/games
                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. NoteEdit preview with gv get errors, without message in gv error 
window (I have gv-3.6.1 with gs-7.07.1);

2. NoteEdit cannot generate PS files:

ErrMsg: "Catastrophe: KNotify"
"A print error ocurred. Error message received from system:"
"Cannot save print file to /home/hudson/print.ps. Check that you have 
write access to it."

(The error persists when set chmod 777 /home/hudson/print.ps; but PDF 
printing is fine)

I tried also install kghostview, but it cannot comunicate to 
ghostscript, suggesting misconfigured printer.

System info:
NoteEdit-2.7.4 3.3.2, (3.1)
Linux (i686) release 2.4.25-1-multimedia-686
Debian Sarge GNU/Linux - DeMuDi-1.2.0 - (with updates)
Window manager: fluxbox-0.9.3 on XFree86, res. 800x600, 15bit
gv-3.6.1
gs-7.07.1
Printer EPSON-C20UX, configured by gnome-cups-manager, using cupsys-bsd

Any suggestions?

Cheer,
Hudson Lacerda

Did you try to link abcm2ps executable to /usr/bin only (local
directories can sometimes got excluded from path) and re-run NoteEdit:
$ ln /usr/local/bin/abcm2ps /usr/bin -s

If this doesn't work, you should try to first export to ABC manually
and then run
$ abcm2ps exported_file.abc

This way you can export to other formats as well (personally, I prefer
LilyPond). For Lily:
$ convert-ly --edit exported_file.ly
$ lilypond exported_file.ly.

Both ways will hopefully produce a usable PDF and PS output.

I'm not really sure why your problem occurs, but direct printing from
NoteEdit is going to have a complete rewrite in version 2.8.1.

Hardware:    x86
OS:          Linux (Fedora Code 3)
NE Version:  2.8.0
KDE Version: 3.3.1

I downloaded, compiled and installed NoteEdit 2.8.0, using the 
--without-libs on configure because I was unable to compile libtse. 
Everything seems to work fine (except for the MIDI stuff I don't expect to 
work), except that nothing can be saved.  Any attempt to do so produces 
the following informative error message:

error opening file <file name>.

This is not a permission issue since I get it no matter where I try to 
save, even if I'm running as root.

Any ideas what might have gone wrong?

Thanks in advance.
