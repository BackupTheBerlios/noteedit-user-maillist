It should work with pmx / musixtex as well as both support hidden
rests as well. A long time ago I used pmx for "producing" music
pieces, nowadays it's lilypond.

abcm2ps does also support compressed (Zn - multimeasure) and hidden (x - 
not multimeasure) rests.

Subject: [Noteedit-user] Enharmonic transposition
Message-ID: <200606090910.27053.rob@arwhalley.freeuk.com>

Is there any way, either in insert or edit mode, that a note can easily be 
changed to its enharmonic equivalent?
MIDI import has to guess which accidentals to apply and of course, sometimes 
gets it wrong. The only option I have found is to change the entire staff to 
all flat or all sharp and this doesn't solve the problem.
If this is not possible at the moment, are there any plans to introduce this 
feature in the future?
Many thanks.

Message-ID: <200606090911.24688.rob@arwhalley.freeuk.com>

Is it possible to change a rest into a note, and vice versa, without having to 
delete and re-enter? It is clear how to alter the duration of a rest or note 
in edit mode, but not how to flip between the two.
Many thanks.

Looks like a KDE issue in NE 2.8.0 where keyboard stopped to work.
Otherwise I can't remember any bug about not being able to delete a
music element (any music element!). Tough luck :( .

I think this issue is now fixed correctly in 2.8.1 and the latest KDE
for some time.

I tried to join the discussion forum (list) , but even that was difficult.  I did successfully (in a limited way ) created a small transposition of a saxophone part with Lilypond.

Highlighting or selecting it and then deleting or back spacing didn't work.  Selecting a new key signature didn't do any real good either.  It just piled another one on.  I tried to import a Lilypond file, but couldn't do that either.  I tied to set a song title and couldn't do that.

Any other suggestions?

I just tried this and it works for me.  I started a new song with the 
key ofEb.  I entered for quarter notes on the bottom line E (treble 
clef).  I then highlighted the last note and selected Tools -> Set all 
to sharp.  It  converted only the selected note to d#.  I hope this helps.
