Subject: [Noteedit-user] How to place two notes of unequal time value?
Message-ID: <20071003231023.EFE631BF28D@ws1-1.us4.outblaze.com>

Folks,

I've been enjoying noteedit, and have been using it to help me learn how to play classical guitar pieces correctly, esp getting the rhythm/timing down. It's a great aid, but classical guitar can have polyphonic voices where two or more simultaneous but relatively independent melodic lines are written. I wanted some advise on score this with noteedit because so far I've only figured out how to place notes of the same value on the same beat, but use ties to lengthen the beat. I don't like this solution very much because it makes the music look different that my book arranges the scores. How to set up a quarter note and half not on the same staff? For example, I would like to write in noteedit quarter note A and half note C written as follows.

P.s. Been looking at canorus, but haven't been able to run the latest due to undefined linking/lib symbols.

High OSC,

in the menue format --> property of staff(?) --> voice, you can add more
voices (and set there the stem direction of it). On the main menue icon
bar, you see a number widget, looks like a lcd display, usually
displaying A like all, on which you can choose the active voice by
clicking with the right and left mouse button on it. For filling up
unused parts of a voice you can use hidden rests.

When I once did a lot of music with multiple voices it sometimes
crashed, especially with ties, and deleting something, so I needed to
save from time to time. But it works. Sometimes I prefer to leave the
voices in NoteEdit in separate staffs, and put it only together in
lilypond by hand.

Regards,
Georg

Subject: [Noteedit-user] How to wrap the staff down the screen?
Message-ID: <20071007184026.39ED916427D@ws1-4.us4.outblaze.com>

Folks,
As I add notes to the staff, it will continue on the same staff from left
to right on screen. If I only have a single staff it is one very long
line. How can I wrap the same staff down the page so that the next
measure starts at the left hand margin (similar to text editor line
wrap)?
Thanks,
-OSC

Hi,

this noteedit can't do. You have to work around it: Either export to
lilypond for example and just look there on it, or, open in --> File -->
new window a second window, so you can copy between the two windows when
you load your file. It's like two edit sessions open.

Regards,
Georg

Subject: [Noteedit-user] Add bar for anacrusis
Message-ID: <5678759e0710131732j414e64c5rb42aa4c5caada23@mail.gmail.com>

Hey!

I love using linux, and I love copying music from my school's original
handwritten notations to easier readable computer generated notations, so I
figured I'd give NoteEdit a go.

Here's my problem though. On one of the pieces I am entering, I have an
anacrusis that I need, which consists of one Bflat quarter note. Looking
around on how to do this, I found this
page<http://noteedit.berlios.de/doc/noteedit.pdf>which tells how to
insert a bar manually, by either highlighting the
post-bar note and clicking 'Tab', or by pressing '|' where the mouse is at.

I tried the highlighting method to no avail. Went on and tried the mouse
method, but that just inserts it before the clef!

Is there any easy way to do this?

Thanks!
