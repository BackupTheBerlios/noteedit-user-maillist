Hi!

As a first time user you will probably come along the questions how to
print from noteedit. I had the same question when using noteedit.
Currently the answer is simple: There is no printing possible with
noteedit. But this weakness has also it's strength: Noteedit offers
several great export modules for programs or tools being able to
print the score in a manner noteedit probably would never achieve
itself. These are currently pmx, musixtex, lilypond, abc and finally
musicxml for programs that support import of this format.
Many of these tools rely on TeX as a base. On most linux distributions
you simply will have to install a tetex package to use the tools.
I personally use lilypond since some months for printing as it has a
very good font and score design. Also it is very easy to create a pdf
or postscript file from the exported file.

Midi is the other big part you will certainly encounter when using
noteedit. Currently tse3 is required for useful midi playing and
recording using noteedit. You can also import or export midi files
created with other programs. If you have a cheap soundcard like I
have you probably want to use timidity as a midi server for playing
the midi file and the soundserver jack (similar to but much better
than arts or esd (esound)) for connecting noteedit and timidity to
your soundcard.

Message-ID: <4151BDC7.30009@web.de>

Hi,

As Mr. Anders has deleted the homepage of noteedit we currently
lack a proper homepage. I found the homepage very good from the
content point of view, the layout and design was quit good as far
as I remember, but in way that I sometimes forgot to download the 
documentation or to look for some important hints.

I hope that Mr Anders grants us access to his original homepage,
or that someone on the list here has a quite recent copy of the
page. Particulary the screenshots and several hints for the normal
user were on this page and might not be in the archive (I'm not
sure about it, I have never compared the archive content to the
homepage content).

The alternative option would be to create a complete new homepage
(which means basically to develop a new layout, design and content).

What are your opinions ?
I would only choose the last option if we don't get access to the
original homepage.

Best Regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Hi all,

two remarks:

- a good homepage is essential (if only for advertizing)
- I won't be able to help much (I am not good at graphics design)

Regards, Leon.

I have never tried to get sound from Noteedit. I have only one Sound 
device, an AC'97 type and I use Alsa.

If I load the snd-virmidi driver from the kernel I get some virtual midi 
devices. Also other midi devices appear if I start the corresponding 
program like the timidity server port. I don't see any sound devices.
You should read the handbook, probably it contains some information.

1) I don't know, but the ac'97 is a very generic thing, there are 
several drivers on Linux for ac'97 based sound chips (intel, sis, via).

2) No, there are many different soundblaster cards out there, very
cheap ones, the 128, the emu10k1 (aka SB Live), Audigy in different
variants, AWE64 at last.

3) I don't understand. But without such a sound card of course I can't

4) Actually noteedit uses either tse3 or midi to play the notes you have
typeset. I have never tried tse3 directly but with midi (using timidity
as a midi server) it works finde for me.

Hi Nigel,

as there might be many missing links for the setup you're seeking for I 
would suggest you to make a first step:

Play a midi file on your soundcard with timidity. When that's done, I 
think noteedit will be the easier part. What happens when you try it?

Then/Or: Start vkeybd and kaconnect and try to connect vkeybd and the 
midi synthesizer and play a sound.

Many things can happen: a) another application is grabbing the 
soundcard, b) timidity doesn't find the right card, c) your midi patch 
set is not appropriate, d) the soundcard is muted, e) the soundcard 
didn't get the download of midipatches if you're planning to use it's 
midi capabibility.

Me, on Suse 9.0, I prefer first let jack grab the soundcard, then put 
timidity on jack to be the software midi synthesizer. For this setup I 
have first to kill Suse's timidity process. I also switch of artsd in 
KDE. For me AC'97, jack, timidity, noteedit, ardour and alsaplayer play 
nicely together.

Usually for every problem I get an error message. Let hear from you,

Best Regards,
Georg Rudolph.
