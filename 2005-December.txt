Hi,

I'm looking for generating volume signatures (is that correct in english ?) 
like "f" (forte), "mf" (mezzoforte) and so on in some pieces of music.

I'm just interested in printed output, not in playing online.
Some tries with musixtex were not very nice looking, the "f", "mf",... doesn't 
stand directly under the note, but left or right from it.

Has anyone experiences with that (or with some other output format) ?

Uli

Really, the positions of dynamics for musixtex seems wrong 
(noteedit-2.7.4 on demudi).

However, the output for abcm2ps (<http://moinejf.free.fr>, 
<http://abcplus.sf.net>) is fine.

Hi,

If I edit the generated .tex file, I use the command zchar for the signatures.

Example:
\Notes\qb0 f|\zchar{-18}\f\en

Wrote like this, everything is fine. Yet I haven't inserted it directly in 
noteedit.

Greetings
Michael

I've posted a shell script at http://www.dcmatthews.f2s.com/music.sh

It gets postscript output from a lilypond, musixtex or abc file, using the file extension to automatically run the correct backend (abcm2ps for abc).

It will also adjust the size of the music on the fly, without altering the file, so if your printout doesn't fit on one page you don't need to do another export from noteedit, just run the script again with a different parameter (-s, -n. -l or -L).

Let me know if you like it or there are problems; include it with noteedit releases if you see fit.
