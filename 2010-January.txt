Hi Alfredo,

did you try to switch the \voiceOne and \voiceTwo parameters in the 
exported .ly file? These two directives tell Lily how the stems should 
be rendered. Looks like NE doesn't set it correctly.


Regards.

Subject: [Noteedit-user] patch: concurrent uptext and downtext in lilypond
	export
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.1.10.0910312153590.17409@dront.rosnix>

Hi!

Yes, I know development have moved on to Canorus, and hope it proceeds 
smoothly. However, if anyone is interested I have a patched a small bug:

Concurrent text sections or dynamics was not exported properly to 
lilypond. For example, if you have both a piano and and forte between two 
notes (perhaps useful when ending a crescendo) only the last "\f" would be 
exported. In the same way, only the last text section would be 
exported (for example, no "Allargando" above and "tutti" below possible).

This patch fixes that (by using a list), and allows any number of 
text/dynamics to be exported. It may be useful also if you, like me, are 
embedding lilypond syntax in the noteedit source (to get many lilypond 
features not directly supported by export) and post-processing the 
exported .ly. (I can send my post-processor if anyone is interested).

Subject: [Noteedit-user] How do I add a title?
Message-ID: <4B587975.4000203@web.de>

Hi,

I'm quite new to noteedit. I've successfully created the intro of 
"Sandmann, lieber Sandmann..." and now I'd like to add a title. There is 
"Insert"->"Text", but with this tool I can only add text immediately 
above or below the lines, not a title, e.g. in bold face.

Any hints?

Thank you,
Christina Rossmanith

Hi Christina.

Use Format->Document information to set title, composer etc.

Hi,  Christina;

Sorry for being slow to respond. But in case you haven't found it
already, The title can be set by clicking on Format > Score
information...  and filling in the fields in the dialog window. The
information entered there will show on the page produced when you export
to lillypond.
